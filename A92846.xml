            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Aint <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> conjectures that the maine intention of the greateſt part of this Pſalm conſiſts in the diſcovery of divine provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, which manifeſts it ſelf in the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and courſes of the heavenly bodies, concerning which the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſpeaketh much, from <hi>v.</hi> 1. to the 7. Saint <hi>Auſtine</hi> (upon the place) is of a quite different o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, who conjectures that Chriſt is the whole ſubject of this Pſalme: whoſe perſon is compared to the Sunne for excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency and beauty, and the courſe of whoſe doctrine was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:115641:6"/>
round about the world by his Apoſtles, to which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> alludes, <hi>(Rom.</hi> 10. 18. <hi>Have they not heard, yes, verily their ſound went into all the earth, &amp;c.)</hi> and the efficacy of whoſe Goſpel is like the heat of the Sunne, which pierceth into the very heart of the earth, ſo that into the ſecrets of the ſoul.</p>
                  <p>I confeſſe this allegorical expoſition, is not altogether im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent, neither is that literal Expoſition of Saint <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> to be blamed, for it hath its weight.</p>
                  <p>But to omit all variety of conjectures, this <hi>Pſalm</hi> containes in it. <note place="margin">The contents of the Pſalm. A double knowledge of God by the book of the creature.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A double kinde of the knowledge of God,</hi> of which one is <hi>by the book of the Creature;</hi> and this Divines call a natural knowledge: there is not any one creature, but it is a leaf writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten all over with the deſcription of God, his <hi>Eternal power and God-head may be underſtood by the things that are ſeen,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 20. And as every creature, ſo eſpecially the Heavens do lead us to the knowledge of a God: ſo <hi>v.</hi> 1. of this <hi>Pſalm: The Heavens declare the glory of God, and the firmament ſheweth his handy work:</hi> they are the Theatres as it were, of his wiſdom, and power, and glory.</p>
                  <p>Another is <hi>by the book of Scripture:</hi> And this knowledge <note place="margin">The book of the Scripture.</note> is far more diſtinct and explicite: with the other, even the Heathens do grope after a Deity, but with this, Chriſtians do behold God as it were with open face: The Characters here are now freſh, ſpiritual, compleat, and lively: The Word of God is the ſingular means to know God aright: Look as the light which comes from the Sunne, ſo that Word of God, which is light, is the cleareſt way to know God who is light it ſelf. Hence it is that the Pſalmiſt ſtands much upon this, from <hi>v.</hi> 7. to <hi>v.</hi> 12. where he ſets open the words in its ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral encomiums and operations, <hi>viz.</hi> in its perfection, its cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainties, and firmneſſe; its righteouſneſs, and purity, and truth, and then in its efficacy: That it is a converting word, an il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightning word, an inſtructing word, a rejoycing word, a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirable word, a warning word, and a rewarding word.</p>
                  <p>2. A <hi>ſingular and experimental knowledge of himſelf,</hi> ſo it <note place="margin">The experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</note> ſeemeth that that word, which <hi>David</hi> did ſo much commend,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:115641:6"/>
he did commend it from an experimental efficacy; he had found it to be a righteous, and holy, and pure, and diſcovering word, laying open, not only viſible and groſs tranſgreſſions, but alſo like the light of the Sunne; Thoſe otherwiſe inob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved and ſecret atomes of ſenſes flying within the houſe, I mean in the ſecret Chambers of the ſoul.</p>
                  <p>Now in this there are two things which the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſets <note place="margin">The parts of the Text.</note> down.</p>
                  <p>1. <hi>A ſad complaint of his ignorance, [who can underſtand his</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">A ſad com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint of his ignorance.</note> 
                     <hi>errors?]</hi> As <hi>Paul</hi> in his caſe ſpake, the <hi>Law is holy, and juſt, and good, and ſpiritual,</hi> but I am <hi>ſold under ſin,</hi> Rom. 7. 12, 14. ſo <hi>David</hi> here, the Law of the Lord is pure, and righteous, and perfect, but I am very ſinful; many ſins I ſee in my ſelf, and more there are which I cannot eſpy, I cannot find them out, nay, I think ſaith he, every mans ſins do ariſe beyond his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts, he cannot give a full and entire liſt of them, <hi>who can und<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>rſtand his errors.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. <hi>An earneſt requeſt,</hi> and that for three things. <note place="margin">An earneſt requeſt. To be clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed from ſecret ſinnes.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>One is to <hi>be cleanſed from ſecret ſins,</hi> which words ſome expound that he deſires to be pardoned, not only his known, but alſo his unknown ſin; Yet others conjecture that his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire reacheth to ſanctification, which might prevaile not only againſt open, but the private and cloſer methods of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</p>
                  <p>2. Another is to be kept from <hi>preſumptuous ſins,</hi> v. 13. Saint <note place="margin">To be kept from preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptuous ſins.</note> 
                     <hi>Auſtin</hi> and others read it, <hi>a ſuperbiis contine ſervum tuum,</hi> keep back thy ſervant from prides. I think their reaſon is becauſe, 1. Pride is a bold and preſuming ſinne. 2. And it is that which is the maine ingredient of a preſumptuous kinde of ſinning: even good men have the root of high tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons within them, into which they may fall, If corruption might have its ſwinge; and if they do not fall into them, it is not becauſe they are able alone to keep them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but becauſe God doth by his ſpirit of grace <hi>keep them back.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. A third is, <hi>the ordering of his words and thoughts,</hi> which he <note place="margin">The ordering of his words and thoughts.</note> deſires might be ſo compoſed, that <hi>they might be always accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in the ſight of God,</hi> v. 14. as if he had ſaid, O Lord, I do not
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:115641:7"/>
only deſire to be kept from the viler wayes of ſin, but from all whatſoever, I would not only not be wicked, but I pray thee that I may be good: As I would not do evil, ſo I would not ſpeak evil, nay as I would not ſpeak, ſo I would not thinke e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, I deſire to be ſoe, as that I may be acceptable before thee; I deſire to do, as that I may be acceptable with thee; I deſire to ſpeake ſo, as that I may be accepted: yea and I deſire to thinke ſo, that I may be acceptable in thy ſight.</p>
                  <p>In my poore Conjecture you have in <hi>David</hi> here a lively copy of an upright heart, which is truly plain all over, and pitcheth upon this, that it may be acceptable with God, and that it may be ſo, it would be wrinſed of all ſins, not only no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious and viſible, but inviſible and ſecret, and it would have not only an outward decency of religion in pious actions, but alſo an inward conformity even of the very thoughts and Meditations of the heart.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall not ſpeak of <hi>Davids</hi> complaint, v. 13. <hi>who can under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand his errors?</hi> only a word and a way.</p>
                  <p>By <hi>errors,</hi> he meanes his unwitting, and inconſiderate mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtakes: <note place="margin">What is meant by errors.</note> There are ſins, ſome which are committed when the Sun ſhines <hi>(i.)</hi> with light and knowledge, and then as it is with colours when the Sunne ſhines, you may ſee them, ſo theſe a man can ſee and know, and confeſs them particularly to be tranſgreſſions: there are other ſins, which are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted either in the times of ignorance, or elſe (if there be knowledge) yet with inobſervance: either of theſe may be ſo heaped up in the particular number of them, that as a man did (when he did Commit them) take no notice of them, ſo now af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the commiſſion, if he ſhould take the brighteſt candle to ſearch all the records of his ſoul, yet many of them would eſcape his notice. And indeed this is a great part of our mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery that we cannot underſtand all our debts: we can eaſily ſee too many, yet many more lie as it were dead, and out of ſight; To ſin is one great miſery, and then to forget our ſins is a miſery too: If in repentance we could ſet the battel in array, point to every individual ſin, in the true and particular times of acting and re-acting, O how would our hearts be more bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with ſhame and ſorrow, and how would we adore the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:115641:7"/>
richneſſe of the treaſure of mercy which muſt have a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude in it, to pardon the multitude of our infinite errors and ſinnes.</p>
                  <p>But this is the comfort, though we cannot underſtand eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry particular ſin, or time of ſinning, yet if we be not idle to ſearch and caſt over the books; and if we be heartily grieved for thoſe ſins which we have found out, and can by true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, turn from them unto God, and <hi>by faith,</hi> unto the blood of Jeſus Chriſt, I ſay, that God, who knowes our ſins better then we know them; and who underſtands the true intentions and diſpoſitions of the heart, that if it did ſee the unknown ſins, it would be anſwerably carried againſt them; He will for his own mercy ſake <hi>forgive them;</hi> and he too <hi>will not remember them.</hi> Nevertheleſs, though <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>who can underſtand his errors?</hi> as the Prophet <hi>Jeremiah</hi> ſpake alſo, <hi>The heart of man is desperately wicked, who can know it?</hi> yet muſt we beſtir our ſelves at heaven to get more and more hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly light to finde out more and more of our ſinnings: So the Lord can ſearch the heart: And though we ſhall never be able to finde out all our ſins which we have committed, yet it is poſſible, and beneficial for us to finde out yet more ſins then yet we do know: And you ſhall find theſe in your own experience, that as ſoon as ever grace entred your hearts, you ſaw ſin in another way then ever you ſaw it before, yea, and the more grace hath traverſed and increaſed in the ſoul, the more full diſcoveries hath it made of ſinnes: It hath ſhewn new ſins as it were, new ſins, not for their being, not as if they were not in the heart and life before, but for their evidence, and our apprehenſion and feeling: we do now ſee ſuch wages, and ſuch inclinations to be ſinful which we did not think to be ſo before: As phyſick brings thoſe humours which had their <note place="margin">Simile.</note> reſidence before, now more to the ſenſe of the Patient: or as the Sun makes open the motes of duſt which were in the roome before, ſo doth the light of the word diſcover more corruption.</p>
                  <p>But I paſſe by that point of the impoſſibility of a full apprehenſion of all ſinnes committed ignorantly, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderately.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="6" facs="tcp:115641:8"/>
I now proceed from <hi>Davids</hi> complaint to <hi>Davids request,</hi>

The Heart of man is A ſcheme of wickedneſs, nay, a man ſaith that in his heart, which he dares not ſpeak with his tongue, and his thought will do that which his hands dare not to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute, well then ſin may be called ſecret, when it is ſin, and acted as ſin, even there, where none but God and Conſcience can ſee; me thinks ſin is like a Candle in a Lauterne where the ſhining is firſt within, and then burſting out at the windows: or like Boyls and ulcerous Humors which are ſcabbes and ſcurvy ſtuffe, firſt within the skin, and afterwards they breake out to the veiw on the outſide, ſo it is with ſin, it is a malignant Humor, and a fretting leproſie, diffuſing it ſelfe into ſeveral ſecret acts and workings within the minde, and then it breaks abroad and dares adventure the practiſe of it ſelfe to the eye of the world, and be it, that it may never ſee the light, that it may be like a Child born and buried in the wombe, yet as that Child is a man, a true man there cloſſetted in that hidden frame of nature, ſo ſin is truely ſin; though it never it gets out beyond the wombe which did conceive and enliven it.</p>
                        <p>Now whether <hi>David</hi> doth ſpeak of ſecret ſins in oppoſition to the eyes of men, or to his own ſenſible eye, <hi>(i.)</hi> ſuch as cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Nature did commit within his own heart; or whether he intends it of both? it may be much diſputed: for my part I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture that it may be underſtood both of ſuch which he might commit in private, &amp; ſo the words reſpect the <hi>actings of ſin in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret,</hi> &amp; alſo which his own heart &amp; thoughts might commit with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in themſelves, and ſo the words reſpect the <hi>ſecret actings of ſin,</hi> though Principally they may be moſt fitly Expounded in this latter ſenſe.</p>

                        <p>Now if this be it, Then thus much is evident, that ſecret thoughts and inclinations may be ſinful and are damnable, or elſe they were not pardonable.</p>
                        <p>2. Another is that <hi>he deſires more to be ſanctified,</hi> and that his <note place="margin">To be more ſanctified.</note> Nature might be more changed, not only that outward ſinnings might be abandoned, but even inward actings or motions might be ſubdued.</p>

                        <p>3. BUt <hi>why ſhould we deſire to be cleanſed from ſecret ſinnes:</hi>

                        <p>I will give you diverſe reaſons of it.</p>
                        <p>1. Becauſe <hi>ſecret ſins will become publike ſins, if they be not cleanſed.</hi> It is with the ſoule, as it is with the body wherein diſeaſes are firſt bred, and then manifeſted; and if you ſuppreſs them not in their root, you ſhall ſhortly ſee them to break out in the fruit: or as it is with fire catching the inſide of the houſe firſt, and there if you doe not ſurpriſe it, it will make way for its ſelfe to get to the outſide. <hi>Luſt when it hath conceived it bringeth forth ſin,</hi> Jam. 1. 15. Beloved, remember this, that though the firſt ground of ſin be within the heart, yet the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſion of ſin is to come forth into publicke: the Child in the wombe hath not ſtronger throwes to get out of its private lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, then ſin ſecretly wrought to fly into open and manifeſt action: <hi>Ammon</hi> is <hi>ſick</hi> with the ſinful Conceptions of inceſtuous luſt, and what ado was there till he had committed that villany: let a man ſet up any ſin in delightful Contemplation and medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations that ſame inward acting of his ſin, Either doth actually
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:115641:11"/>
Caſt him upon the outward adventures, or invites them. This is the leaſt that it doth, it doth ſtrangly ripen his naturall incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; and beſides that it doth prepare him for a temptation that ſuits that way: Satan ſhall not need to tempt him much, who hath already tempted himſelf: and he who will work ſin in his heart, a weak occaſion will draw it out into his life, <hi>thirty pieces of ſilver</hi> will prevaile with a <hi>covetous Judas,</hi> who had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſold his Maſter in his heart.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Object.</hi> But what of that, will you ſay, ſuppoſe that ſecret ſins uncleanſed do become publicke.</p>
                        <p>I ſay therefore, ſhould we the rather labour to cleanſe them: for as much as the more publick ſin becomes, the worſe it is you know, that if the word or letter of the minde be written in paper, now it becomes a copy for others to write after, whilſt ſecret ſins are confined the houſe <hi>(i.)</hi> to the ſoule only, and break not out into viſible act, though they be very damnable, yet they are but of perſonal and proper danger, they indanger him only who maintaines them, as poyſon doth him who takes the poyſon; But when they come to publick and viſible actings, then they are a copy, they are exemplary ſins, &amp; like the Plague infecting other perſons, others are capable to imitate them, and ſoe more ſouls are tainted, and God now receives a common diſhonour.</p>
                        <p>2. <hi>Secret ſins are apt to deceive us moſt,</hi> &amp; therefore cleanſe there; <note place="margin">Secret ſins are apt to deceive us moſt.</note> there is a deceitfulneſſe in all ſinnings whatſoever, the ſoule is couſened by ſin whenſoever it doth ſin; but now ſecret ſins deceive us moſt, they are moſt apt to prevaile with us: partly,</p>
                        <p>1. Becauſe <hi>we have not that ſtrict and ſpirituall judgement of the inwards of ſin, as of the outwards:</hi> many times we conceive of them as no ſins at all, or elſe as ſlight and veniall, to draw a ſword, and run a man thorow the heart; O this is a fearful murder, to draw a falſe word, and ſlanderouſly to pierce thorow his good name, we likewiſe imagine that this may be bad, but to kill a man with malicious thoughts, with revengeful plots and deſires, nay, this is ſcarce thought as a matter culpable, or at leaſt very excuſable. Beloved, it is the ingenium of ſin to come off eaſily in the ſoule without ſtir and debate, and no ſins come off ſo eaſily, as thoſe with we ſcarce imagine to be ſins. Now we are apt to think that ſecret ſinnes are ſcarce ſinnes.</p>

2. And becauſe <hi>Most men decline ſinne upon outward reſpects,</hi> which doe not reach the actings of ſecret ſins, ſhame and fear, and obſervance are great, and the only reſtraints to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. They doe not live in, and viſibly commit ſuch ſins, becauſe they like not ſhame, and are afraid of puniſhment, but what are thoſe to ſecret ſinnings, where no Law of man can reach, and no ey of man can ſearch. It is true, that God hath ſet ſome one or other to watch the ſinner al over, as his law for inward, &amp; outward actings; <hi>his conſcience</hi> principally for the inward, and the <hi>eyes</hi> and <hi>mouths,</hi> and <hi>hands of men</hi> for the outward: but now for ſecret ſinning, it being inviſible, it doth therefore eſcape all the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward reſtraints by the ſeeing, and ſpeaking, and judging of men; and it hath mainly to attend what conſcience wil ſay, which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps is ignorant or drouſy, &amp; if it doth ſpeak yet it is not regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: Now mark of all ſins eye them moſt, which do moſt eaſily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive you, theſe a man commits moſt, affects moſt, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues in longeſt, ſince therefore ſecret ſins come under that form, is it not neceſſary to labour to be cleanſed from them.</p>

                        <p>1. Lies in its <hi>nearneſſe to the fountaine,</hi> from whence it can take a quick, immediate, and continual ſupply, and ſo doe our ſecret ſins, they are as neare to Originall ſin, as the firſt drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pings are to the ſpringe head: they are indeed Originall ſin immediatly acting it ſelfe, which ſin is a full ſin, a feeding ſin, a ſinning ſin, and never weary.</p>
                        <p>2. It Lies <hi>in the acceptance of the affections:</hi> love and liking ſet ſin upon its throne: They are the Armes royall of a ſinne; now of the two, men are more apt to like and love ſecret then open ſinnings.</p>
                        <p>3. It lies <hi>in the confidence of Commiſſion:</hi> Now a man doth

take more heart and boldneſſe and courage to commit ſecret ſins then open.</p>
                        <p>4. It lies <hi>in the iteration and frequency of acting,</hi> for ſinne often repeated &amp; acted, is like a cable doubled in ſtrength by the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold twiſtings, but ſecret ſins are more frequently iterated; an uncleane heart can keep a whore in his thoughts every day and moment, who perhaps is afraid to be ſeen at the door of her houſe once a yeare: a proud perſon can diſdaine another in his heart all the week, who yet will not ſhew it once a month, ſo for the malicious, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                        <p>There be at the leaſt three horrible ſins which now thou doeſt commit at once.</p>

                        <p>A third is <hi>Atheiſme:</hi> if there be not formal Atheiſme, yet there is a virtual Atheiſm, as if God were no God in ſecret, but only in publick, that he could ſee in the light and not in the darkneſs; that his eye is as the eye of a man only: whereas he <note place="margin">The principle of ſinning is ſecret and common to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man.</note> is an univerſal eye, and is a light without all darkneſs.</p>

The motions of ſinning are not like the motions of a bowle which runs only by the vertue of an imprinted ſtrength, they are not violent motions whoſe cauſe is only extrinſecal, but they are natural motions, whoſe principle is within the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject: <hi>out of the heart</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>proceed evil thoughts, adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries, fornications, murders, thefts, covetouſneſſe, malice, deceit, laſciviouſneſſe, an evil eye, blasphemy, pride, fooliſhneſſe, all theſe evil things come from within and defile the man,</hi> Mark 7. 21, 22, 23. the nature which tempts thee, that nature is in thee, it is the womb of many and infinite ſinful corruptions, and imaginations: it caſts out wickedneſs as the fountain caſts forth water; ſo the Prophet, <hi>Jer.</hi> 5. 7. it is very true, that outward occaſions, and Satan by his ſuggeſtions may aſſiſt and quicken original corruption, as the bellows may enflame the fire, yet the fire hath heat, and an aptneſs naturally to burne. So original corruption, though it may grow monſtrouſly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive by temptations from abroad, yet it can and doth incline us, and can beget private actings of horrible ſinnes, from its own native ſtrength, it can ſend out ſeveral forms of ſinning, and incline us to contemplate upon them, yea to contrive the ſingular methods of tranſgreſſion, yea, it can feed the ſoul with wonderful delights in them, ſo that in the eye of God, the ſinnings are formed, and faſhioned, and ripened with moſt of odious perfections.</p>

                        <p>Now mark it: when reſpect to man is the only reaſon, why I forbear ſin, I am all this while looſe and unconſciona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in the inward frame, all my care is taken up about thoſe actions and carriages which fall under the eye and judgement of man; and none but the viſible and open actings of ſinne break out that way: If I forbear ſin for mans ſake, that men may eſteeme well of me, and not cenſure or puniſh me, I therefore ſo far reſtraine ſin as it may not be viſible, but I do not ſtrive againſt it, becauſe it is ſinful; I ſay, not becauſe the thing is ſinful before God, but only becauſe it is culpable before man: now try your ſelves in this: what is the reſtraint of your ſinning: ſuppoſe all men in the world were in a dead ſleep, ſuppoſe that no eye did ſee thee, ſuppoſe that no tongue of humane juſtice would call thee to account: would not thy heart then with full ſail ſpread out it ſelf: wouldſt thou not now, like the lions in the night, wander about for thy preys; would not thy heart turn out it ſelf, let go it ſelf, drive out its ſecret inclinations: wouldſt thou not do that in any place which now thou committeſt in ſecret corners.</p>

                        <p n="1">1.

<pb n="25" facs="tcp:115641:17"/>
more to labour againſt the corruption, unto which the tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion would ſecretly encline: as if Satan ſhould tempt to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret pride; not only not to admit the temptation, but now to go to God and pray more earneſtly againſt a proud im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agination, and a proud ſpirit, yea, to be vehement for an heart more lowly and humble; or if Satan doth tempt to contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plative uncleanneſs, or ſecret actings, not only to reſiſt and abhor them, but to pray more earneſtly for a Chaſt and pure heart, and for chaſt and ſpiritual imaginations and thoughts.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Conſider <hi>how far forth thou deſirest to approve thy ſelfe</hi>

                           <hi>to God.</hi> God is the God of our ſpirits as well as of our bodies, and he doth not only ponder our paths, but doth alſo ſearch our hearts: That thou ſendeſt forth ſome words in prayer, O this ſatisfies not becauſe of ſo many diſtractions in the minde, and of ſo many deadneſſes in the affection: that man cannot accuſe thee for any habitual unevenneſſe, this is not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, if God cannot approve of thee for a perſon <hi>after his own heart:</hi> if thy heart were ſuch as God would like regard, approve, accept, then thou wouldeſt be better ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.</p>
                        <p>There is a twofold approving of our ſelves, one in the <hi>conſcionable exactneſſe of duty appertaining to our callings;</hi> hence the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 3. <hi>giving no offence in any thing that the Miniſtry be not blamed:</hi> verſ. 4. <hi>But in all things approving our ſelves as the Miniſters of God in much patience, in afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, in neceſſities, in diſtreſſes.</hi>

<pb n="26" facs="tcp:115641:18"/>
over unto Gods ſentence of tryal and deciſion ſo, that he might find an acceptance from his eyes, but he doth indeed deſire to be cleanſed from ſecret ſinnes; why? becauſe Gods ſentence is righteous and according to truth, he doth not weigh ſo much, the actions as the ſpirits of men, not ſo much the outward expreſſions as the inward diſpoſitions; not ſo much what they do, as what they would do; not ſo much that they do not, as this that they would do no iniquity I remember that <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> is upon this very ſtraine, in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 139. 23. <hi>Search me O Lord, and know my heart, and know my thoughts,</hi> v. 24. <hi>And ſo if there be any wicked way in me:</hi> Here he puts himſelf intirely upon God, to try him, to ſearch him, to ſee whether his heart be ſuch as he ſhould like and approve. <hi>Paul</hi> is in the ſame ſtraine, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 3. with <hi>me it is a very ſmall thing that I ſhould be judged of you; (i.)</hi> whether you approve of me or not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of me, or condemn me, I tell you, this is not the main thing that I look on, <hi>v.</hi> 4. <hi>But he that judgeth me is the Lord, (i.)</hi> there is another Judge, a greater Judge, a better Judge, one who can canvaſe the ſecret and inward parts, as well, as eye the meere viſible acts and motions, to him do I look, to him do I deſire to approve my ſelf.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Obſerve, <hi>where doeſt thou lay the ſharpeſt edge of the axe:</hi>

Now as a man may deal with a tree, ſo he may deal with his ſinnes; the axe may be employed only to lop off the branches, which yet all live in the root, and he may apply his axe to the very root, to the cutting of it up, and ſo he brings an univerſal death to the tree: So it is poſſible for a man to beſtow all his pains to lop off ſinne onely in the viſible branches in the outward limbes of it, and it is alſo poſſible for a man to be crucifying the ſecret luſt, the very corrupt nature and root of ſinfulneſs. Now this I ſay, he who beſtows his ſtudy, his prayers, his tears, his cares, his watchings, his ſtrength to mortifie corruption in the root, in the nature, in the cauſe, how unqueſtionable is it
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:115641:18"/>
that he doth deſire to be cleanſed from ſecret ſins. Suppoſe a man hath an ulcerous part (undiſcovered) in his breaſt: if he applieth ſuch phyſick which will carry away the ſpring of that ulcer, it is a palpable ſigne he doth deſire to be cleared from the ſecret ulcer it ſelf: ſo it is in this caſe.</p>

Beloved, to tye <hi>Sampſons</hi> armes, it was a vaine thing, his ſtrength lay not there; but if the hair of his head be cut off, then his ſtrength is gone, and he ſhall become weak. To tamper (only) with the acts of ſinne is not the way to be rid of ſinful acts. But the ſingular way to be rid of bad acts, is to be rid of a bad nature: the vertue of the effect al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes lurks in the cauſe, and therefore it is the cauſe which gives life and death to it. If thou couldeſt once get an holy nature, which might be at defiance with ſinne in its throne; know this, that a new nature and daily combat would much help againſt ſecret ſinnings. That ſinne is leaſt of all acted with life, which is moſt of all combated within the heart:

thereof: all which, give mee now liberty to open and explaine: conſider therefore.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. <hi>That preſumptuous ſinnings are proud adventurings of the heart upon ſinne;</hi> there is a large difference 'twixt foilings <note place="margin">Preſumptuous ſinnings are proud adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turings upon ſin.</note> by temptation, and adventurings by preſumption: Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion beats down that actual ſtrength of grace reſiſting: but preſumption tramples down the light of the word oppoſing: therefore preſumptuous ſinners are ſaid to ſinne with an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted, or <hi>high hand;</hi> the ſinner doth put aſide Gods will, and prefers his own: <hi>Our tongues are our own,</hi> ſaid they, <hi>who is Lord over us?</hi> Pſal. 12. yea, they are ſaid to ſet their <label type="milestone">

                        <p>1. One is the <hi>facility of mercy:</hi> when a man ſets mercy againſt ſinne, he doth well, (becauſe Gods mercies ſhould draw our hearts off from ſinne) but when a man ſets mercy againſt Juſtice, now he offends; yet thus doth the preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous ſinner, perhaps there is not in every preſumptuous ſinner ſuch a ſpirit of Atheiſtical madneſſe; that he is abſolutely careleſſe of all that God threatens, nor is he ſo miſerably prodigal of his ſoul, that he rejoyceth to have it damned, no, he may and ſometimes doth apprehend threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, yea, ſo that his heart is cauſed to demurre, it may be a ſtopping apprehenſion <hi>(i.)</hi> ſuch as may make him ſtudy
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:115641:33"/>
how to purſue his ſinne, and yet to wave and decline the edge of the ſharp threatning, and this he doth by oppoſing mercy to juſtice; 'tis true, this is a ſinne, and divine juſtice will not take it well, but I will adventure on it, hoping that divine mercy will pacifie the rigor of the threatning, I will ſin and offend Juſtice, but then I will decline that Court, by flying to the Mercy-ſeat: God is of a gentle heart, eaſie to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated, and will be preſently ſatisfied and appeaſed: Juſt like a man who will break his bones, becauſe he truſts to have them quickly ſet by a skilful Chirurgion, or like a lewd child, who adventures to outrages, upon the ſcope and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance of his fathers good nature: This ground of preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption God fully intimates in <hi>Deut.</hi> 29. 19. <hi>when he heareth the words of the curſe, that he bleſſe himſelf in his heart, ſaying, I ſhall have peace, though I walk in the imagination of mine heart, to adde drunkenneſs to thirſt, &amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Beloved, this is certain that preſumption diſpoſeth of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy beyond all allowance, and writes a pardon which God will never allow nor ſeal: it will dare to runne in debt upon a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of a diſcharge, and clearing however: as if Divine mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy were nothing elſe but a preſent untwining of all the knots which we make, and a croſſing of debts as ſoon as entred, and ſerved for no other end, but that men ſhould be bold to ſinne, and cheerful after the commiſſion of it; But verily mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy is more precious then ſo.</p>
                        <p>2. Another is <hi>the ſelf poſſibility and ſtrength of future re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance:</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Of the ſelf poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility of fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture repentance</note> he is one of the worſt patients in a way of ſinning, who is confident that he can be his own Phyſician: no ſoul wounds it ſelf more then that which vainly thinks that it can preſently cure them; preſumption is not alwayes carried up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on an abſolute hope of mercy, but the ſinner being more piercingly underſtanding knows that mercy is a ſpecial Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and ſuch a balme as is ſpread only upon a returning and humbling ſoule; here it is that this preſumptuous perſon will adventure to ſinne upon a confidence that he will (notwithſtanding all this) faſhion and poliſh his ſoul to a meet capacity of mercy, by hereafter repentings and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blings: he doth fooliſhly delude his ſoul with a fancy of ſuch
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:115641:34"/>
things which exceed his power. There are two things which the ſinner cannot aſſure himſelf of.</p>
                        <p>One is the <hi>lengthning of his life:</hi> for this candle is lighted and put out, not according to our deſires, but according to divine pleaſure: all life hath its limits from the Lord of life and death: he who ſinnes to day, cannot be aſſured that he ſhall live till to morrow. Now repentance is a work of this life: death bindes us over to ſentence, and then 'tis too late to return: And therefore every preſumptuous ſinner adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures boldly upon that which cannot be his, beyond the time preſent.</p>
                        <p>Another is the <hi>returning of the heart from ſinne,</hi> though our natural principles can give the wound, yet they muſt be ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural principles, which give the cure: our own hearts can cauſe us to fall, but Gods grace only is that which raiſeth us; Now Gods grace is Gods gift, and not mans ſtock: though we alone can fall off from God by ſinne, yet none but God can bring us back from ſin by true repentance unto himſelf: yet preſumption makes the heart bold, not only with time (which is in Gods hand) but alſo with grace, which is only in Gods gift: Though I ſinne, yet I will hereafter repent, thus the preſumptuous ſoul, whoſe life may be inſtantly cut off, and to whom God may therefore deny his grace to repent, becauſe it did before-hand preſume to ſin.</p>
                        <p>5. In many <hi>preſumptuous ſinnings there is a ſlighting con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt:</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">It is with a ſlighting con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt.</note> therefore, <hi>Numb.</hi> 15. 30, 31. preſumptuous ſinning is called a <hi>deſpiſing of the Word of the Lord: the ſoul that doth ought preſumptuouſly, &amp;c. ſhall be cut off, becauſe he hath deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Word of the Lord, &amp;c.</hi> to deſpiſe the Word of the Lord, is to eſteeme of it as a vaine thing, to diſregard it in his authority and Majeſty over our conſciences, and hearts, and wayes: As if a ſoul ſhould ſay, what care I though God doth ſpeak thus and thus; I will not be curbed, and limited, nor reſtrained: this is to contemn God: And it is called a rebelling againſt him, <hi>Deut.</hi> 1. 24. <hi>I spake unto you, and you would not heare, but rebelled against the Commandment of the Lord, and went up preſumptuouſly to the hill.)</hi> It is called a <hi>casting of Gods Law behinde our back;</hi> God hath hemmed
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:115641:34"/>
and circumſcribed the ſoul with precepts, within which if a man walks, he hath God to be his ſecurity, but in preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptuous ſinnings a man will exceed his limits, and yet believe a ſafety: this very thing is expreſſed in <hi>Deut.</hi> 17. 11. <hi>Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the ſentence of the Law, which they ſhall teach thee, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the judgement which they ſhall tell thee, thou ſhalt do, thou ſhalt not decline from the ſentence which they ſhall ſhew thee, to the right hand or to the left,</hi> ver. 12. <hi>And the man that will do preſumptuouſly, and will not hearken to the Prieſt, &amp;c.</hi> even <hi>that man ſhall die,</hi> ver. 13. <hi>And all the people ſhall h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Now the perſon who ſinned preſumptuouſly, would not ſtand to this, but would break over this ſentence, and would go in his own way, he diſregarded what God ſpake, that ſhould not be his rule, no not his.</p>

                        <p>This kinde of preſumptuous ſinning, is not only to ſinne, though a man knows it, nor only to ſin, becauſe a man will ſin, but it is alſo to ſin on purpoſe to diſhonour God, and to vex his holy ſpirit; the ſoul is grown unto that abominable inſolency, that a man even plots deliberately how to croſſe God, and will therefore apply himſelf to ſuch words and acts, becauſe he knows they will diſpleaſe God; this is the very top and height of preſumptuous ſinning: when a man in a ſober and calme ſpirit exempted from violent diſeaſes and ſtrong paſſions, and inſolently turbulent temptations, ſhall in ſober circumſtances, deſperately, and of malicious and ſet purpoſe encounter God, adventure iniquity, to provoke God: he knows that the worſt which ſhall befall him is damnation,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:115641:35"/>
but he cares not for that, he will however have his pleaſure in ſinne, and will ſtrive to deſpite that God, who ſtands in a juſt enmity to his ſoul and ſins.</p>

                           <p>1. <hi>Such ſinnes would be exemplary and noted:</hi> There are three things which ſet a man upon the ſtage, which lift up his actions on high to the eye of the word.</p>

                           <p>Another is his <hi>ſingular dignity:</hi> lift a man out of the croud, advance him to a place and ſeat of honour above others, how buſie is the multitude to eye, and judge, and imitate him. The wayes and actions of great perſons (are uſually) the preſent copies of the moſt.</p>
                           <p>A third is <hi>his notorious miſcarriages,</hi> which are like the tayle of a blazing comet; the great ſinning of good orgreat men, fall inſtantly into common diſcourſe and (perhaps) al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo eaſily into common practice. Therefore great cauſe had <hi>David</hi> to pray againſt preſumptuous ſinnes, which by his practice might prove a common ſnare, for who will not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently write after that ſinful copy, which both goodneſſe and greatneſſe have begun: that which the great man dot<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                           <p>Now this might be ſome cauſe to move good <hi>David</hi> to pray to be kept back from preſumptuous ſins, knowing how his acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were capital copies, wrote in Text Letters: And that the ſinnings of great men are like the fallings of Cedars, which bring downe with them to the ground many low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſhrubs: And that the ſinnings of good men are eaſily ſnares, whereby other men would encourage and deceive themſelves.</p>

                           <p>One is the accompliſhing of their own projects and luſts.</p>

The traveller, his will is to go the right way, and in that to ſtand, yet he may ſtumble and fall down, and this may be called an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity: But if he be himſelf, and ſhould put off his cloaths, and lay himſelf down in the dirt, this were an act of a vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary madneſſe; ſo when a man ſets himſelf to ſin, when he will go and wallow in the mire; when with <hi>Ahab, he ſells himſelf to work wickedneſſe,</hi> that he doth bargaine away his ſoul for a ſin; when he gives up himſelf to uncleanneſs with greedineſs, this is no infirmity, it is a height of proud preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption; But through infirmity of prevalent reſiſtance, a good man may be <hi>ſold under ſin,</hi> as <hi>Paul,</hi> he may be led <hi>captive,</hi> being over-ſurprized, he may be led with <hi>Peter,</hi> that way, or to that fact, which yet he would not willingly do.</p>

Nine Rules How to be kept from preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptuous ſins. Beware of a courſe of little ſins.</note> to the obſervation of ſome particular Rules, that ſo we <hi>may be kept from preſumptuous ſinnings.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>1. <hi>Beware of a courſe of little ſins:</hi> The ſtirrop, though it be low and ſmall, yet it doth ſerve a man to mount; the great flames of fire took their beginning from a cole or a ſpark: And men, uſually, have been firſt wading in leſſer ſins, who are now ſwimming in great tranſgreſſions: ſinnings (ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed as little or inconſiderable) have not only this happineſſe, that they are not ſo much regarded, but this unhappineſs that they are more often committed: And then this is certain: That the frequent commiſſion of ſmall ſins is great in it ſelf, and doth alſo diſpoſe and prepare to greater commiſſions; many drops make a currant: he who makes no conſcience of acting many little ſins, will ſhortly take the boldneſs to aſſay and act ſome great ſin.</p>
                        <p>For, 1. The more any ſin is committed, the more is the <label type="milestone">
                              <seg type="milestoneunit">Note. </seg>
                           </label> judgement blinded and corrupted. 2. The more are the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons inclined and ſeduced. 3. The more is conſcience be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numbed and ſeared. 4. The leſſer force have divine argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments with the ſoul, being ſurfeited with the pleaſures of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ſinnes, and then it muſt well follow, that the heart be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus qualified, may eaſily be wrought upon to a foul com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion: this I finde, that the way to be kept from an high ſin, is to fear the leaſt ſin.</p>
                        <p>For little ſinnings are not like a little inch of candle which goes off in an abſolute period, but they are like a traine of powder, which takes fire from corn to corne, till at length the barrel is burſt aſunder, or like a little ſickneſſe which is an humour diſpoſing to a ſtronger diſtemper: or like a little circle in a pond, which begets greater and greater.</p>
                        <p>I obſerve three things.</p>
                        <p n="1">
                           <pb n="90" facs="tcp:115641:50"/>
1. <hi>That Satan hath a ſtrange hand over that ſoul which can</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Satan hath a ſtrong hand over the ſoul which can bear with any ſin.</note> 
                           <hi>bear with any ſin:</hi> he may by leſſer things maintain his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand: as it was ſaid that the little childe did command the land, for the childe prevailed with the Queen, and the Queen with the King, and he over the land: Satan can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail for a little ſin, and a little ſin can prevail with the heart, and the heart with the whole man.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. <hi>That little ſinnes are breeding ſinnes:</hi> Now ſinne will keep its bounds, but naturally would greaten it ſelf; though <note place="margin">Little ſins are breeding ſins.</note> it ſeeme modeſt at firſt, yet will it by degrees become familiar and impudent.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. <hi>They are entiſings ſinnes,</hi> they are the advocates in the <note place="margin">They are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticing ſins.</note> boſome for greater, they do not onely labour for their own lodging, but will deale ſtrongly with the heart to embrace greater, as occaſion and temptations preſent themſelves.</p>
                        <p>Therefore this do give the water leave, no not a little: little ſtreames makes way to the ocean. And thou ſtudieſt the preſent way, to become a great tranſgreſſor, to riſe to preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptuous ſinnings, who wilt allow thy ſelfe to be an habitually immoderate ſinner.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, <hi>take heed of the iterations of any ſinne, (viz.)</hi> do not go a ſinne over and over: of all tranſgreſſions, <note place="margin">Take heed of the Iterations of any ſin.</note> which diſpoſe the ſoule towards preſumption, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated have <hi>a</hi> ſpecial influence, and I will give you a reaſon for it,</p>
                        <p>Becauſe preſumptuous ſinnings depend much upon the boldneſs of the heart: when the heart becomes bold and fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, <label type="milestone">
                              <seg type="milestoneunit">Note. </seg>
                           </label> it will then venture thorough thick and thin, it will preſume far, they were men who <hi>ſinned with both hands,</hi> and as high as <hi>Sodom,</hi> who came to this paſſe, that <hi>they knew no ſhame.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Now ſinnes of iteration, or repeated ſinnes, they frame a boldneſſe in the heart (as repeated blows do the anvile) and the more hardened the heart is, the more bold it growes; partly becauſe they delude the heart, they work falſe prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples in the minde; foraſmuch as we have gone on in theſe courſes again, and againe, and no evil befals us, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:115641:50"/>
to morrow ſhall be as to day, let us eat, and drink, and ſinne.</p>
                        <p>It was a ſweet adviſe that of <hi>Elihu,</hi> Job 34. 32. <hi>That which I ſee not, teach thou me, if I have done iniquity, I will do no more:</hi> for all ſinne grows ſtrong by practiſe, and the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten going over it is like the motion of the feet from one round of the ladder to the other, ſtill riſing, or like the manifold turnings of the wheel, which mounts the weight ſtill to an higher pitch; what <hi>Job</hi> therefore ſpake in another caſe, <hi>Once have I ſpoken, but I will not anſwer, yea, twice, but I will proceed no further,</hi> Job 40. 5. that I ſay unto thee, once thou haſt ſinned, thus, and thus, yea, twiſe, and yet conſcience is tender, there is yet fear and ſorrow, but proceed no further, leaſt that become mighty to ſinne. This is certaine, that the ſtronger ſin grows, the more eaſily will a ſinner preſume. Now repeated ſinnings do wedge in the ſin with ſtrength, as the more often the Schollar writes after the copy, the fairer he writes, and the more he is enabled to write: ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ſinnings makes the ſoul more ſtrong in that kind, and then more fit for a worſer.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, <hi>do not ſtifle or reject the frequent checks of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience:</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Do not ſtifle the frequent checks of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</note> God hath appointed ſeveral things to give the ſinner a touch, like cords to twine him in, to keep him from ſinnings, <hi>viz.</hi> the voice of the word, and the voice of judgement, and the voice of men, and the voice of his own conſcience.</p>
                        <p>Now mark it, there are two of theſe voices (more eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially) which if a man will neglect and ſlight, a thouſand to one, but he will fall to be a preſumptuous ſinner, <hi>viz.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="1">1. <hi>The voice of the Word,</hi> Prov. 29. 1. <hi>He that being often reproved, hardened his neck, ſhall ſuddenly be deſtroyed, and that without remedy.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="2">2. <hi>The voice of conſcience:</hi> when the conſcience ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre with the word, in its informing acts, and in its directing acts, and in its warning acts, and in its reſtrictive acts, and in its corrective and judicial acts, <hi>(i.)</hi> it ſhall point the way, or fact, in the evil, and unlawful quality of it, and ſtrive,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:115641:51"/>
and reaſon, and fret, and reprove, and threaten, yea, and ſpeak bitterly, yet a man will go on, I ſay, this man haſtens to ſome great ſin, to preſumptuous ſinnings.</p>
                        <p>I will give you a reaſon for it, becauſe the Lord will forſake this man, he will leave him to himſelf, he will give him up to his own heart: ſince he will not hearken to the counſel of the word, nor to the adviſes of his conſcience, God will ſtrive with him no more, but he ſhall be left to himſelf, this is the uſual courſe of Gods righteous and judicial proceeding. Now what can the heart do, being left to it ſelfe, as it hath no ſtrength againſt a great temptation, ſo it hath ſufficient ſtrength and deſire to; for the greateſt methods of tranſgreſſings; if reſtriction be a merciful bond to corruption, then wrathful deſertion, a deſertion of the creature, <hi>(i.)</hi> a denial of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting aſſiſtance againſt temptation or inclination, or act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, why it is as the unmuzling of the Maſtive, or untying of the Lion, Not that God ſets on the heart to ſinne, but that the heart will in a moment be mighty in ſinning, which is judicially deſerted, or left by God for former ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings.</p>
                        <p>Therefore, I beſeech you take heed of ſcorning divine ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitions and reproofs: Conſider that place well in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 81. 11. <hi>But my people would not hearken to my voice, and Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael would none of me,</hi> ver. 12. ſo <hi>I gave them up to their own hearts luſt, and they walked in their own counſels:</hi> if thy heart can riſe above the word, it will riſe above thy conſcience, and if thy heart riſe above thy conſcience, thy next ſinnings will riſe above thy former: he will not be modeſt to ſinne, who growes impudent againſt the word, and violent againſt his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, <hi>ſecure not the heart becauſe of Gods preſent ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence.</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Be not ſecure becauſe of Gods preſent ſilence.</note>

And though he be ſilent many times at the ſinnings of men, yet this is but forbearance, it is not an acquittance, if thou takes the times to ſinne, God will take his turn to puniſh, <hi>Pſal,</hi> 50. 21. <hi>Theſe things haſt thou done, and I kept ſilence, thou thoughteſt that I was altogether ſuch a one as thy ſelf, but I will reprove thee, and ſet them in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der before thine eyes.</hi>

                        <p>
                           <hi>Sol.</hi> Very much; for preſumptuous ſinnings depend much upon ſecurity: a man ſecures his facts and wayes from this, that God is ſilent and does not preſently draw the ſword; ſend for the arreſt: and therefore preſumes to a ſecond or greater ſinning, from God connivence and patience toward former. <hi>Solomon</hi> inſinuates it clearly, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 8. 11. <hi>Becauſe ſentence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt an evil work is not executed ſpeedily, therefore the heart of the ſonnes of men is fully ſet in them to do evil, q. d.</hi> There is now no ho, they make no bones of it, they will venture yet again: But brethren: take heed; if you ſin, and yet you proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per in the world; if you ſin, and yet conſcience be quiet; if you ſinne, and yet God preſents not a preſent teſtimony of his diſpleaſure; yet do not preſume: for if you do evil, ſinne lies at the doore: firſt or laſt, when you open it, your ſins ſhall flie in your face: though the puniſhment of the ſinner be not preſent, yet it is certaine: <hi>it ſhall not be well with the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, though he prolong his dayes,</hi> Eccleſs. 8. 13. yea, the <hi>ſinner of an hundred years old ſhall be accurſed:</hi> And this is obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable, that Gods ſilence towards a forward tranſgreſſor, is made up at length, not only with certainty, but with number and meaſure: perhaps he will take ſuch a time to account with thee, for thy ſinnings, that he will break thee ſuddenly all to pieces; he will break thy eſtate, and thy conſcience, and thy body, and thy ſoul, and all, and all irrecoverably for ever.</p>

                        <p n="1">1. That Mercy, the very intent of it, the pulſe of it, it is to draw a man off from ſin: it is true, Mercy is an harbor, but not for the Traitor to thruſt in his ſhip, it is a City of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge, but not for the audacions man-ſlayer: O! No, Mercy it is the tendereſt goodneſs, but withal it is a ſpecial goodneſs, and is ſet up not as a light by the ſea, that a man may know thereby how to ſail more freely, that a man ſhould therefore ſin more violently, but as a proclamation from a Prince, to draw in the rebel to ſheath his ſword, and to fall down on his knees. <hi>There is Mercy with thee, therefore ſhalt thou be feared,</hi> ſaid <hi>David; And knoweſt thou not, O man,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>that the goodneſs of God ſhould lead thee to Repentance;</hi> Rom. 2. 4. Hath God mercy to pardon me? with what heart can I then preſume to provoke him; Hath he Mercy to pardon me? How canſt thou then, O my ſoul, hold on thy ſins, &amp; not return when Mercy ſends a Meſſage after thee, it is the laſt, and moſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing motive for a ſinner to repent, even this that God will be mercifull to him.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Mercy miſ-proved to the ſin, is both juſtly denied to the ſinner, and alſo intends his ſin: The only way to forſake our Mercies, is that we will not forſake our ſins: God will never ſhew thee Mercy, if tbou wilt not return from ſinning

                        <p>6. Sixthly, Conſider this, <hi>That it is a difficult thing to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">It is a difficult thing to repent</note> and that the more a man doth ſin, the more hard it is to repent of his ſins.</p>

                        <p>Now if a man were throughly convinced of two things, this ground would ſink, and perhaps his heart might be taken off from preſuming.</p>
                        <p>1. One is, <hi>That it is a difficult thing to repent;</hi> Why? Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance is the new ſetting of the heart and life: it is the very contradiction of a mans former love and practiſe, it is the undoing of all his doings, it is the ſhifting (as it were) of his nature, and the tranſplanting of himſelf, the divor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of the affections, the new bent and edge of the ſoul for all holy and pious obedience: and is this an eaſie thing? Is it
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:115641:53"/>
eaſie for a man to become an enemy to himſelf, to lay down his ſweet delight, his precious profits, his cloſer nature, to judge and condemn his heart and wayes, for ever to forſake his own counſels, his own inclinations, his own courſes: Know you not, that to ſneath up but an idle word and form of language, is not ſo facile an act? how much more then to put off root and branch? Do we not ſtick in the ſame ſins after many threatnings of wrath, after many executions of Judgement, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter many invitations by mercies, after dayly counſels and directions by thy Word, after inſtances and examples of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment; nay, after particular and perſonal experiences of the deceitfulneſs and bitterneſs of our ſinnings: Doth not this ſhew that it is a difficult thing to repent?</p>
                        <p>Nay, Take an Aſſay of thy heart, begin the ſtudy of thy ſelf, remember thy doings which have not been good, thy wayes that have been evil, ſummon up all the matter of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, (for if Repentance be true, it muſt be an univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal turning) and then ſet upon the work of Repentance, and tell me whether former ſins cannot plead hard for future and conſtant poſſeſſion, whether they cannot work mightily and deceitfully? tell me how willing and ready thou ſhalt find thy heart which comes to this duty as a Thief to the Executioner? Tell me whether Satan will eaſily give up his Title and intereſt, and will give Chriſt poſſeſſion quietly without many fervent ſuits to heaven, yea, without bitter and ſtrong conflicts, yea, unleſs the Almighty God himſelf come in, and turn him out of thy heart, and turn thy heart to him.</p>

Why? what is that which ſpoils us, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arms us of ſtrength, is it not ſin? then the more ſinning, ſtill the leſs ſtrength to return from ſin. Nay, ſin doth not only corrupt our ſtrength, by multiplied ſinnings, but withal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſeth its own ſtrength: the more a man doth ſin, the weaker and weaker he becomes, and ſin thereby becomes ſtronger and ſtronger: Now tell me, if it be hard for thee in

ſtrength to turn from ſin, will it not be harder for thee in weakneſs to conquer ſtrength? if thou canſt not ſtep over the brook, why, doſt imagine it eaſie to ſtride over the Ocean? If thou canſt nor ſtand before the child, thinks thou in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to caſt down the ſtrong man? ſurely by thy continued and multiplied courſe of ſinning, thy mind is more blinded, and thy Judgement is more corrupted, and thy love is more inflamed, and thy heart is more hardned; and art not thou then more diſabled?</p>
                        <p>Once again; by thy more ſinnings, the Counſels of God are more deſpiſed by thee: and the Spirit of God is more grieved and reſiſted by thee, and the Mercies of God are more abuſed by thee, and the patience of God is more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faned and injured by thee, ſo that God in Juſtice may forſake thee, and deny his hand for ever unto thee, and then, thou, what wilt thou do? what canſt thou do?</p>
                        <p>I beſeech you lay theſe things to heart; they may check, and hold off your hearts from preſuming: why thinks the ſoul, here is a temptation to ſin, yea, but I muſt repent, and it is not ſo eaſie, that to do, if it be, let me try about my former ſins, without a new addition now: and then this I am ſure of, that the more ſinnings will make the work of Repentance more hard, foraſmuch as they wedge in the ſin more into the affections, and provoke God more, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> therefore it ſhall ſuffice me to have ſinned already: I will adventure no more, nor no further.</p>

                        <p>One is <hi>lawful (i.)</hi> ſuch a dominion and ſubjection <note place="margin">There is a do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion lawful.</note> which the word and will of God doth or will warrant, as that of perſons over perſons, or of God and Chriſt over all perſons and creatures: God may command us, for he made us; and Chriſt may command us, for he redeemed us, both our perſons and our ſervices fall unto him, <hi>we are not our own, for we are bought with a price,</hi> therefore ſerve or <hi>glorifie God in your body, and in your ſpirit, which are Gods,</hi> 1 Corinth. 6. 19, 20.</p>
                        <p>Another is <hi>unlawful,</hi> and as it were uſurped, which is <note place="margin">Unlawful.</note> when command is exerciſed, and obedience given, without any juſt title or right; and this Dominion is either aſſumed by <hi>Satan,</hi> who is called the <hi>Prince of the aire,</hi> and the <hi>Prince of darkneſſ,</hi> and a <hi>Ruler,</hi> and <hi>one who works mightily in the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of diſobedience:</hi> or elſe it is exerciſed <hi>by ſin, ſinne</hi> is ſaid to <hi>have a Dominion, a Law,</hi> a rule over a ſinner, and the ſinner is ſaid to <hi>obey</hi> the ſin, to <hi>ſerve</hi> it, to <hi>fulfil the luſts</hi> of it, &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, conſider, that the dominion of ſinne doth imply <note place="margin">The dominion of ſin doth im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply. Singular power and ſtrength with authority.</note> two things.</p>
                        <p>One is <hi>ſingular power and ſtrength</hi> joyned <hi>with authority.</hi> The authority of it conſiſts in this, that it doth command the man (as a King doth his Subjects) and the ſtrength of it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in this, that it is able to make its commands to be obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and followed.</p>
                        <p>Another is <hi>quiet, willing and total yeelding of ſubjection to</hi>

                        <p>The latter of theſe is expreſſed; ſometimes by <hi>fulfilling the deſires of the fleſh;</hi> and by <hi>having the converſation in the lusts of the fleſh,</hi> Eph. 2. 3. and by <hi>being ſervant to unrighteouſneſſe,</hi> Rom. 6. and by <hi>taking pleaſure in ſinne,</hi> and by <hi>ſinning with greedineſſe,</hi> and by <hi>ſelling of a mans ſelf to work wickedneſſe,</hi> and by <hi>giving</hi> up our ſelves, or <hi>our ſelves over to uncleanneſs;</hi> when a man doth as it were by a proper and voluntary act ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render up his ſoul to the obedience of iniquity, as the ſervant paſſeth away himſelf, when he takes ſuch an one to be his Lord, that all his faculties, and ſtrength, and deſignes, and maine intentions ſhall ſubmit themſelves to the ſervice of his luſts and ſinnes.</p>
                        <p>So that dominion <hi>of ſinne on ſins part,</hi> comprehends ſtrong and compleat power, a commanding and diſpoſing power, and <hi>on the ſinners part,</hi> it comprehends reſignation, and compleat ſubjection: A moleſting power doth not conſtitute its domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, <label type="milestone">

                        <p>But a little more to wade into this point, ſinne may <note place="margin">Sin may be ſaid to have domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</note> be ſaid to have Dominion, or to reigne in a threefold reſpect.</p>
                        <p>1. <hi>In reſpect of aſſent:</hi> when the underſtanding ſubjects it <note place="margin">In reſpect of aſſent.</note> ſelf to its motions: I ſay ſubjects it ſelf, for there are two acts of the mind about the motions and commands of ſinne; one is <hi>apprehenſion,</hi> another is <hi>ſubjection:</hi> a man may appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend ſin as working, and yet he may not embrace, but reſiſt that working of ſin: And then it is not ſinne in dominion: If I ſee an enemy approaching, and riſe up to oppoſe that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy, he is now an enemy encountering, but he is not a King ruling: ſo that it is not meere apprehenſion, but ſubjection <note place="margin">Two ſorts of ſubjection.</note> which puts up ſin into the Throne, into a dominion: <hi>(i.)</hi> when ſin gives the command, and the ſinner yeelds thereto, Renders up himſelf to the obedience, freely gives way unto, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertains the motions of ſin.</p>
                        <p>And hereto we muſt again diſtinguiſh of that ſubjection of aſſent which denominates Dominion, that it is not a meer paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive ſubjection (as when a man is taken priſoner) but an active ſubjection, a ſubjection of approbation, as when a ſervant hears the will of his Maſter, and he likes it ſo where ſin hath dominion, the ſinner doth not give a naked aſſent, but an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving aſſent, he allows his ſinne and approves of his ſinfull courſe.</p>
                        <p>Neither is this all, for every <hi>active aſſent</hi> is not ſufficient to <note place="margin">Aſſent is either precipitated or deliberated.</note> denominate dominion; a man may be on a ſudden circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented, he may be under the quickneſs and ſtrength of a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation, he may be ſo over-born by ſudden paſſion, that poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly he may aſſent, and approve a ſin in reſpect of the fact, in this or that particular, for this and that time, as a true ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject (ſuppoſe one of <hi>Davids)</hi> not underſtanding all thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, not pawſing, was drawn to the conſpiracy on <hi>Abſolons</hi> ſide, ſo a Chriſtian, in whom ſin hath not a proper domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he may on a ſudden be ſo enſnared by ſin and tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:115641:58"/>
that he gives way unto it, yet afterwards he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnes to himſelf, and condemns his own act by ſound re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.</p>
                        <p>Therefore know, that the aſſent which ſets up ſin in domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion it is double. <note place="margin">Twofold aſſent that ſets up ſin in dominion. 1. Antecedent.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>One is <hi>Antecedent:</hi> and this aſſent is ſuch a work of the minde, wherein ſin is not only not rejected and condemned, but yeelded unto and approved: what <hi>Abraham</hi> anſwered in another caſe to <hi>Iſaac,</hi> calling out, my father, he preſently anſwered, <hi>here am I my ſonne;</hi> ſo when ſinfull corruption thruſts out the ſinful inclination or motion, the ſinner preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly anſwers, here am I, I am ready to do thy will, I like it, I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low it.</p>
                        <p>The other is <hi>Conſequent:</hi> this is an aſſent not only when a <note place="margin">Conſequent.</note> ſin is to be committed, but after it is committed, and that too, not whiles the heat of ſinful deceit or temptation remaines, and lies upon the ſoul, but when that is gone off; when matters grow quiet, and ſober and calme; then a man he likes his fact, he likes his courſe, he doth not only antecedently <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe miſchief on his bed,</hi> and <hi>abhorres not evil:</hi> and <hi>ſets him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in a way that is not good,</hi> (as <hi>David</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 36. 4.) But he <hi>rejoyceth when he hath done evil, and delights in the frowardneſs of the wicked</hi> (as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Prov.</hi> 2. 14.)</p>
                        <p>Even a godly man by temptation, and by infirmity may yeeld an antecedent aſſent, but then as ſoon as he comes to himſelf again, as ſoon as he recovers his judgement to be cleare, and his affections to be calme, he will then ſet upon himſelf and reverſe his own acts; he will judge and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn both his deed and his aſſent <hi>(ſuch a fool was I,</hi> ſaid <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid)</hi> and he will hate himſelf and his ſinful yeeldings <hi>(ſuch a beaſt was I,</hi> ſaid <hi>David</hi> again) and he will not reſt in ſuch an eſtate; <hi>Peter goes out and weeps bitterly,</hi> ſo that even his underhanding will condemn his underſtanding, his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding by a ſubſequent act of judiciary ſentence will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn and diſ-allow, yea, and diſ-avow the antecedent act of the underſtanding in aſſenting and yeelding: the ſerious judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment will condemn the raſh judgement; As a man who hath
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:115641:58"/>
fooliſhly yeelded to the bond, if he can get it into his hands he will now blot out his name, and tear off his ſeal, ſo it will be in this caſe.</p>
                        <p>But where ſin is in dominion, there is not only antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently <hi>permiſſio (i.)</hi> a free and favourable leave given to the committing of ſin, but conſequently there is <hi>adheſio</hi> and <hi>defenſio:</hi> the man approves and upholds that which was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted; there is not a revocation of the fact, a man doth not put in, and ſue out a Writ of Error againſt himſelf <hi>(i.)</hi> that he was circumvented by deceit and miſtake, nor doth he make proteſtation againſt his ſinful commiſſions, but ſtill owns them as being ready to proceed and advance on for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward: he gave his band before that ſin ſhould be done, and now the ſin being drawn out, as it were, into a deed of his own approbation he further confirms the ſame, by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding thereto his Seal, he approves it ſtill, and ſaith, <hi>To morrow ſhall be as to day, and much more abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Secondly, <hi>In reſpect of the conſent of the will,</hi> when the <note place="margin">In reſpect of the conſent of the will.</note> will declares it ſelfe expreſly as a party for ſinne. Beloved! the diſpoſition of the will is the faireſt throne of ſinnes domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and as we judge of the dominion of grace farre better by the will and affections, then by the workings and reaches of the underſtanding; ſo on the contrary we may more ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly judge and determine of the dominion of ſin by the frame and bent of the will, then by any other faculty: whatſoever may be diſcourſed about natural actions, for their prime and principal cauſation, whether by the will or by the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, yet this is moſt true in morals, that the greateſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination is from the will, either for good or evil: and this holds in the caſe of ſinnes dominion; the will hath (in a ſort) the caſting voice, it is one of the chief, of the Royal Armes and ſupporters of the ſinful Throne: ſin is ſtrong indeed, when it hath taken ſeiſure and poſſeſſion of the will, the more corrupt a mans will is, the more ſtrong is corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the man; ſinne is high, when the ſinner will ſin, and <label type="milestone">

<pb n="108" facs="tcp:115641:59"/>
to the will, and they do all of them demonſtrate ſinnes dominion.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. <hi>Conſenſus:</hi> you know that the conſent of the will is <note place="margin">Conſent.</note> that which makes the match 'twixt perſon and perſon (in Law, the Canon Law, <hi>conſenſus, non concubitus facit matrimonium)</hi> ſo here the conſenting of the will, it is the eſpouſing and contracting of the ſoul and ſinne together: I will be a Lord to thee, ſaith ſinne, and I will be a ſervant to thee, ſaith the ſinner: I will give thee pleaſure and profit, ſaith ſinne, and I will give thee my heart and obedience, ſaith the ſinner.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. <hi>Electio:</hi> this is ſuch an act or work of the will in which <note place="margin">Election.</note> a man prefers one thing before another, or one way before a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother: And where ſinne is in dominion, the ſinner would rather be ſinful then godly, he would rather go on in his ſins then forſake them; <hi>They love darkneſs rather then light,</hi> Joh. 3. 19. <hi>Thou loveſt evil more then good, and lying rather then to ſpeak righteouſneſs,</hi> Pſal. 52. 3. as it was with the <hi>Hebrew ſervant,</hi> when the <hi>year of Jubilee</hi> was come, liberty was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded unto him, he might go free if he would, it did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon his own choice, but the ſervant (ſomtimes) he loved his Maſter, he would not go free: So when the Lord comes to a man in whom ſinne doth exerciſe dominion, and propounds unto him ſeveral things, and ſeveral ways, here is Heaven, and here is Hell; here is Life, and here is Death; here is Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and here is Sin; here is the way of Duty, and here is the way of Diſobedience; why as <hi>Eſau</hi> made choice of the poore meſſe of pottage, or as the <hi>Jews</hi> of <hi>Barabbas;</hi> ſo the ſinner, he makes choice of his ſins and ſinful ways, I had rather keep my drunkenneſſe ſtill, my uncleanneſs ſtill, my covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſtill, &amp;c.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. <hi>Imperium</hi> or <hi>propoſitum:</hi> the will is the chief wheel of the <note place="margin">Command and Rule.</note> ſoul; it is that which in a ſort commands all the faculties, and all their acts: now where the will is chief in ſin, if ſinning be the fruits of its luſtful commands: a man hath ſet up his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, it is the purpoſe of his heart, to be as he hath been, and to do as he hath done, he will not learn to do good, he will hold faſt his wickedneſs, here ſin is in dominion.
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:115641:59"/>
Nevertheleſs for the clear diſcovery of this part of ſins do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion in reſpect of the will, be pleaſed to obſerve ſeveral things.</p>
                        <p>1. That there is a <hi>twoſold will.</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">There is a two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold will. Single.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>1. One is <hi>altogether ſingle in its workings,</hi> it doth not part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly incline to good, and partly to evil, but either only to good, or only to evil, <hi>v. g.</hi> where the created nature (which is reaſonable) was never morally deformed, or where the rational nature is gloriouſly reformed, there the will inclines only to good, (as in the Angels and bleſſed ſouls) ſo again, where the nature is totally deformed, (I mean in reſpect of ſpirituals) where it is intirely corrupted, there the Bias of the will draws the ſoul only to evil, the whole ponde, weight, and ſtrength of the will is for ſin: and the ſinner (without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny intrinſecal oppoſition of another nature in the will) will yeeld and ſurrender up himſelf unto ſin. Now ſuch a will as this plainly argues dominion of ſin: where the will, what it is and can do, that it is and will do for ſin; when we may ſay of the will as Saint <hi>John</hi> of the world; <hi>the whole world lies in wickedneſs,</hi> 1 Joh. 5. 19. ſo the whole will (the whole frame and bent of it) is univerſally obediential, or ſerviceable, where the whole nature of the will vents it ſelf into an habitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al and plenary conſent; This is of it ſelf manifeſt, that ſin hath dominion.</p>
                        <p>Another is <hi>mixt and compounded:</hi> when the will is divided <note place="margin">Mixt and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded.</note> within it ſelf, and conſequently its conſents and diſſents (em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracings and refuſing) are likewiſe oppoſed one to another, and oppoſing each the other in the ſame man: you muſt know that original ſin (which yet in part remaines) is diffu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed through the whole man, and into every faculty; and ſo renuing grace (which is oppoſitite thereto) is an univerſal temper, diſperſed into every faculty too: Neither is it able utterly to diſ-lodge ſin in reſpect of being on ſome actings: So that a regenerate man (as Saint <hi>Auſtin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>

                           </hi> ſpake) hath in him an old man and a new man: his fleſh is like a dead man, and his ſpirit like a living man; the living man moves up, the dead man hangs down; the living mans breath is ſweet, the dead mans ſavour is loathſome; ſo far forth as the will is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:115641:60"/>

                           </gap>bed by remaining and working corruption, ſo far forth it is willing and ready enough to conſent to ſinful actings.</p>
                        <p>Now when we ſay that the dominion of ſin depends upon the will, this is not to be underſtood of the compounded will, or of the aſſent and actions which do ariſe from a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and will imperfectly renewed and cleanſed in reſpect of degrees: But of the ſingle and corrupt, and ſo compleat will wherein the conſent is total and plenary. Now the plenary conſent of the will conſiſts properly in the full and natural, and longing inclination of the will after ſin; when the will embraceth an evil, ſets the heart upon it, bends after it, and that without any reſiſtance or ſtriving: ſo that it is the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing of ſin, with an unſtriving conſent of the will, which ſets up the dominion.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Queſt.</hi> 1. Here now falls in a ſubtle and deep enquiry whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <note place="margin">Whether all reſiſtance im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairs dominion and no reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance argueth it. All reſiſtance doth not preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice dominion.</note> 
                           <hi>all reſiſtance impairs dominion, and no reſiſtance doth always infallibly argue it.</hi>

                        <p>
                           <hi>Sol.</hi> I anſwer briefly to the firſt.</p>
                        <p>1. <hi>That all reſiſtance doth not prejudice dominion:</hi> A man may hold a firme league with ſin in his heart, he may be a ſervant to it, though ſometimes in ſome particulars he may skirmiſh and quarrel.</p>
                        <p>There is therefore a double reſiſtance, or denying, or diſputing <note place="margin">A twofold re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance.</note> with ſin.</p>
                        <p>One is <hi>Collateral</hi> and <hi>accidental;</hi> which doth not ariſe <note place="margin">Collateral and Accidental.</note> from an immediate contrariety of nature, but from a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of effects: As now a man in whom ſin hath dominion, his ſinnings may be ſent back with ſuch bitter Writs of attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that he may ſtand at defiance, and be at ſome forbear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance (a while) from ſin: or he may have ſuch affected ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions of death and hell, and ſhame and terror: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he may reſiſt ſin as penal and painful: as a thing ſo bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vexing, and galling, and this grieves him too.</p>
                        <p>Another is <hi>natural and immediate:</hi> which depends on an <note place="margin">Natural and immediate.</note> holy nature implanted in the ſoul, which oppoſeth ſinne as a thing formally evil and diſpleaſing to God: This reſiſtance
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:115641:60"/>
doth (I confeſs) prejudice ſin in its dominion, but the former doth not.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, <hi>No reſtraint doth imply the conſent to be plenary,</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">No reſiſtance doth imply a plenary conſent</note> and therefore ſinne to be in dominion: when the eſtate of the ſoul is ſuch, that no contrary quality ſtands twixt the command of ſin and the obedience of a ſinner, it is eaſie to point who is Lord of the Houſe: and indeed what doth more palpably demonſtrate dominion, then a quiet ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection. <label type="milestone">

                        <p>It is not all the commandings of ſin (alone) which argue dominion infallibly (an enemy may command much, and high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as <hi>Sennacherib,</hi> and yet not be obeyed) but it is conſent, and the more full and quiet kinde of conſent, which is that where no reſiſtance is made) this ſhews that the ſtrong man poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſeth the houſe.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Queſt.</hi> 2. But yet another queſtion is raiſed, and to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, <note place="margin">Whether a good man may not yeeld a plenary conſent in whom ſin hath not domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</note> whether a good man, in whom ſinne hath not domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, may not yeeld a plenary conſent of will: which if, then plenary conſent argues not dominion.</p>
                        <p>I will tell you what I conjecture about it, in a few pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions.</p>
                        <p>1. <hi>It is poſſible that he may ſinne willingly:</hi> two Intenſive <note place="margin">A good man may ſin wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly.</note> aggravations of ſin (in reſpect of particulars) may befall a good man, <hi>viz.</hi> he may ſin knowingly, and he may ſin willingly: the cauſe whereof is this, becauſe his will is but in part renued, and therefore may be a willing principle; neither doth this ſet up ſin in dominion, though it greatens ſin in the commiſſion; for as much as not every particular willingneſs, but an habitual &amp; a compleat willingneſs aſſures ſin of its dominion.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, obſerve, <hi>that there is a double concourſe of the wills</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">There is a double con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of the will to ſin. Reall.</note> 
                           <hi>conſent to ſin.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>One is <hi>real,</hi> when in truth the whole compoſition, and all the inclination of the will is for ſin, the bent of it, and Bias, all runs that way: and where it is thus, there ſin is in dominion.</p>
                        <p>Another is <hi>ſenſible;</hi> which is an obſerved acting of the will <note place="margin">Senſible.</note> as embracing, and leaguing it with ſin: when all (which may
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:115641:61"/>
for the preſent be obſerved) is a corrupt inclination and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent: Now here I conjecture, that poſſibly ſin may not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes have dominion, where yet, for the preſent, and for a particular, the whole ſenſible part of the will ſeems only for ſinne.</p>
                        <p>My reaſon is this, <hi>q.</hi> the reſiſtances of grace are ſecret and <label type="milestone">
                              <seg type="milestoneunit">Note. </seg>
                           </label> more hidden; and again, when the ſoul is hurried to a ſin in the heate of temptations and paſſions, it is not eaſily able to obſerve every ſecret and tranſient regretting and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, you muſt diſtinguiſh <hi>'twixt dominion of ſin, and twixt</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Diſtinguiſh twixt domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of ſin, and a ſtrong incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to ſin.</note> 
                           <hi>a ſtrong inclination to ſin:</hi> dominion of ſin is a thing more natural, but the ſtrong inclination may be preternatural: as a ſtone by ſtrength may be vehemently carried upward, or an arrow out of a bowe, and yet the propenſions of their nature are quite contrary and downward.</p>
                        <p>A man in a violent temptation, and under the ſtrength of a ſeduced judgement, like a captive, he may be exceedingly haled, he may put on eargerly for a ſin, yet with ſome little reluctancy, with ſome ſtrivings on the other ſide, with ſome diſſentings, though faint, though feeble, though not able to put by the actually greater ſtrength of the temptation: ſo that the will may be ſtrongly inclined, when yet it is not to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally inclined; the violent flying out of the ſoul, may be but the hurrying ſtrength of an enemy, which marcheth in haſte: againſt which the Regenerate part of the will may put in its exceptions, and though unable to ſtay the ſoul, yet it may be able to appeal to heaven againſt this raſh and ſtrong work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>4. Laſtly, you muſt diſtinguiſh <hi>'twixt facts, and 'twixt</hi>

                        <p>Once again obſerve, that the work or obedience to ſin is <note place="margin">The obedience to ſin is twofold</note> twofold.</p>

Againſt which, if I miſtake not, <hi>David</hi> doth here principally bend himſelf, when he prays <hi>[Let not them have dominion over me]</hi> that is, not only, let them not rule, but which is beyond that, let them not ſo much as prevail over me: Though I may meet with temptations to preſumptuous and high ſinnings, though I may finde a falſe nature ready e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to break forth upon a vain confidence, yet Lord do thou then ſo effectually aide and aſſiſt me, that I may not only reſiſt, but refel them; though they may attempt, yet let not them once conquer nor overcome me; let me never yeeld to them, nor act them: yet if any think that he aimes at the habitual dominion of thoſe ſinnes; I will not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the liſts, let him enjoy his opinion, but I think this of actual dominion is more punctuall to the place.</p>

                        <p>Now this is a deceit; For,</p>
                        <p>1. It is moſt probable <hi>that ſin hath the ſtrongeſt dominion, where the heart is moſt unſenſible of the Law and commands of ſinne; when the strong man keeps the houſe, all is quiet,</hi> ſaid our Saviour, where ſubjection is peaceable; there do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion is (in all likelihood) moſt abſolute and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat.</p>
                        <p>Nay, this is certain, that where Chriſt ſets up his Scepter (which caſt down the dominion of ſin) there is the greateſt ſtirre, the <hi>Law of the minde will warre againſt the Law of the members,</hi> Rom. 7. 23. And the <hi>ſpirit will luſt againſt the fleſh,</hi> Gal. 5. 17.</p>
                        <p>2. This <hi>unſenſibleneſs</hi> and quietneſſe may ariſe, partly from the <hi>onelineſs of ſin,</hi> and partly from the <hi>ignorance of a ſinful condition,</hi> and partly from the <hi>habitual cuſtome of ſin:</hi> Whether <note place="margin">Simile.</note> the Sun doth ſhine or not, there are as many atomes and motes flying in the roome, there they are really, though not ſenſibly till the light comes in to manifeſt them. When a man <note place="margin">Simile.</note> is in a deadly diſeaſe, he may be void of all ſenſe of it, his life may be even dropping out, and his diſeaſe may rule in his body, though he feeles not any aches, or paine; for this unſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibleneſs depends upon the ſtrength of his diſeaſe, which hath not only pierced his natural temper, but his ſenſes alſo: ſo may a perſon be utterly unſenſible of ſin for want of all ſaving light, and holy experience which ariſeth from a new na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>Nay, and as we ſee men in bondage, and ſlavery, when they <note place="margin">Simile.</note> are long in the ſame, grow unſenſible, and the hand which is uſed to iron, and nettles, is not ſenſible of them; ſo the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent actings of ſin may ſuppreſſe the inward ſenſe of ſinning, this being an eaſie obſervation, and moſt true, that much ſinning adds to the ſtrength of ſin, and diſables the ſenſe of a ſinner, ſears his conſcience, and makes his mind reprobate, and as it were without ſenſe. <note place="margin">From a free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom from ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny courſes of ſinful actings.</note>

                        <p>2. Another deceit may be <hi>a freedom from many courſes of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful actings:</hi> when a man is not like every whore, that proſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes

                        </p>
                        <p n="1">1.

                           <hi>of ſinning;</hi> becauſe a man doth not every moment, or eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day lie at his ſin, but there are oft-times ſome pauſes and diſtances of time 'twixt ſinning and ſinning; he therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures that ſin hath not dominion over him: why? becauſe where ſin hath dominion, there a man ſells himſelf to ſinne, and wallows himſelf in ſinning, and makes it his trade, at which he ſpends his life and ſtrength.</p>
                        <p>To this I alſo anſwer, that yet ſin may have dominion, though there be ſome reſpites and breathings 'twixt ſinning and ſinning. For,</p>
                        <p>1.

                        <p>2. Again, the <hi>dominion of ſin doth not abſolutely conſiſt in an uninterrupted propagation or ſervice of ſinful acts, (i.)</hi> that a man doth not other particular acts, but ſin, ſin; the drunkard is under the power of drunkenneſs, though he be diverſe times ſober; and the fil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>3. Nay, for <hi>a man to give no reſpite to ſinful actings, this were againſt that wiſdom of the fleſh,</hi> which concurs to make up the dominion of ſinne; though the propenſion to ſin may be and is conſtant, though the love of the ſin may be, and is great, yet the actings of ſin may often vary, and be ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended, upon private reaſons and reſpects, either of ſafety, or <note place="margin">From the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of ſome actions contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to ourward ſinnings.</note> quiet, or profit, or pleaſure, &amp;c.</p>

                           <hi>of exerciſe:</hi> becauſe a man is perhaps a conſtant Church-man, and hath a courſe of duties (ſuch as they are) in his family, and he is much in vowings, and can condemn ſin to purpoſe: now ſurely ſin hath loſt its dominion.</p>
                        <p>I anſwer, that notwithſtanding all this, yet ſin may be in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion: For,</p>
                        <p>1. <hi>The dominion of</hi> ſin is within.</p>
                        <p>2. <hi>It may conſiſt with many viſible acts of piety:</hi> I will clear this unto you by propounding one caſe, what think you of an hypocrite, hath no ſin dominion in him? you will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe it hath, and verily it hath; but now even an hypocrite may ſtep forth into all outward conformities, I know no vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible act of impiety, which an hypocrite either doth not, or may not perform.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, though <hi>thoſe material good acts be formally oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to ſinful acts as acts, yet as the denomination of a Chriſtian, ſo that of a ſinner is more from the affections then from the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> and indeed this defines and decides the dominion, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominion of ſin immediately, <hi>viz.</hi> the diſpoſition of the heart, which may be really rotten and falſe, and the true har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour of a ſin, though the perſon doth get out to the acting of ſome viſible duties of piety.

                        <p>Beloved! when a perſon makes choice of Chriſt to be his Lord, he doth conſider the ſeveral kinds of dominion (of ſin, of the World, of the Devil, of Chriſt) he conſiders them ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly, and compares them, and then he findes that no do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion for a mans ſoul, is like Chriſts; none ſo righteous and juſt, none ſo holy and heavenly, none ſo ſweet and profitable: Chriſt hath the only right to the ſoul, and his government is infinitely beſt.</p>

you cannot reconcile them into an objective unity: that which is a reaſon of the love in one, is a reaſon of hatred in the other.

                           <hi>its dominion (is a more ſingular or particular way;</hi> my meaning is this, that there may be in him yet a more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar twange, and more apt inclination, and propenſion to ſome one ſin rather then to another: Sin (yet abiding) may take the advantage of the ſame complexion ſtill remaining, and of the ſame condition and calling yet continuing, and without all doubt, moſt men living, whether good, or whether bad, do finde more to do with ſome one ſinful inclination, then with another.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, conſider: <hi>uſually, that particular inclination, which was in dominion before converſion, is moſt frequent in inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>

                        <p>One, becauſe <hi>that was the ſpring of the ſinne of our cuſtome:</hi> which ſent out and fed the iſſue, by which the ſoule was ſo beaten in the path and way of ſinning, ſo that the old and accuſtomed nature cannot eaſily or preſently forget its anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent and wonted bents: a cuſtome will hardly or never go off, without ſome after inclinations or diſpoſitions that way.</p>
                        <p>Another, becauſe <hi>the new reſiſtances of a converted heart, and its cares and studies are moſt againſt the particular ſinne of its ſpecial inclinations:</hi> there it deals moſt, oppoſeth moſt, humbles moſt: Now ſin doth uſually ſtickle and ſtirre moſt, where it is moſt purſued: that particular ſin, whoſe death thou layeſt at moſt, that will ſtrive to aſſaile and perplex, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangle thee moſt: the more humble thou laboureſt to be, the more ſhalt thou finde proud thoughts to aſſault, though not to conquer thee; and the more meek thou labours to be, the more ado ſhalt thou have with thy paſſions: for as much as no ſin will be executed quietly, and every nature ſtirs buſily in its own defence: we are weakeſt there, and God drawes our greateſt watch and ſtrength thither: a man ſooner falls under leſſer conflicts: when a ſinne hath been beaten upon by much temptation and conflict, the heart grows hereby more ready, reſolute: and you ſhall finde it, that after frequent and long exerciſe with a particular corruption, that it ſhall not eaſily get within the ſoul, but upon a pauſe and ceſſation.</p>

                        <p>Take all that I ſhall ſay to this in a few words.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. It is certain, that <hi>in an evil man there is a frequency in a particular inclination,</hi> and ſo there <hi>may be in a good man,</hi> but <note place="margin">There is a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference betwixt frequent incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations in an evill and a good man.</note> thus they <hi>differ.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>In an evil man, the frequent inclination, is the frequent progreſs of a King: In a good man, it is the fervent egreſſe or attempt of an enemy.</p>
                        <p>In an evil man, the frequency of inclination is to maintain poſſeſſion; In a good man, it is but a malicious endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, <note place="margin">Though the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſault be fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent yet the Reſiſtance is conſtant.

                        <p>There are three things which I would ſay to this ſcruple. <note place="margin">Anſwered.</note>

                        <p n="1">1. One is this, that it is a very ſad ſcruple, any particular victory of any great ſin (for to that I intend the caſe) makes a wonderful change.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Another is this, comfort cannot be applied, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will the conſcience receive it till repentance be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Yet there is a difference twixt a particular victory, and the dominion of ſin; there may be a ſurpriſal, where yet a Kingdom is not eſtabliſhed.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. For the firſt of theſe, <hi>all particular victories are ſad things:</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Particular vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctories are ſad things.</note> I do no not now ſpeak of victories in reſpect of inward mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or of paſſion or diſtemper through dulneſs and melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly, but of victory in reſpect of action, and that not by meer omiſſion, not by imperfection in beſt ſervices, but by groſſe commiſſions, ſuppoſe it <hi>Davids</hi> caſe, or <hi>Noahs</hi> caſe; the one for uncleanneſs, the other for drunkenneſſe: Theſe acted wickedneſſes are ſore evils, very abominable to the Lord, very inglorious to religion, very wounding to conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, extreamly quenching of the ſpirit of grace.</p>

                        <p>Do I finde an evil man brought to the ſight of his ſinnes, to ſaddeſt humbling for them, to ſincere deſire to come off from them, to pantings after grace, and mercy, I now come in with the blood of Chriſt, with the tender and gracious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes refreſhing ſuch a ſoul with aſſurance of freeſt and ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt mercy: Do I finde a good man, weak in duty, ſtrong in affection, hearty againſt all ſin, yet troubled with the inſolent motions of many corruptions? would not do evil, and yet is not rid of it; would do good, but then findes evil is preſent with him; I labour to raiſe and hold up ſuch an heart to look on God through Chriſt for acceptance, to lay hold on Chriſt, for ſtrength, for life, for power, for victory.</p>

                        <p>Five differences twixt dominion and victory.</p>
                        <p>Firſt, <hi>particular victory depends upon inequality of actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all ſtrength, but dominion depends upon the fulneſs of a corrupt nature.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>There is in all holy men an <hi>habitual ſtrength,</hi> which is ſeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the new nature of grace or holineſſe, by which they are inclined to all good, and their hearts made averſe to all evil, it is the natural temper of true grace thus to work: And then there is an <hi>actual ſtrength,</hi> by which, when any particular good is propoſed, they incline unto the obedience of it; and when any particular evil is objected, they ſtrive againſt it and reſiſt. Now it may fall out, that when a temptation preſents it ſelf and inward corruption works with that temptation; I ſay it may ſo fall out, that the ſtrength of grace may be inſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, it may not actually equal or exceed that vehement &amp; actual ſtrength of inclination and temptation, though it doth reſiſt (as a weak man may a ſtrong enemy) yet it may not be able to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer, but is ſurpriſed and led captive: and here the fall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends, not on the diſpoſition of the will or heart, but upon the impotency of reſiſtance; the perſon doth not fall down, but is beaten down; the ſinne is acted, not through choice, but through weakneſs; not becauſe the perſon loves it, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is not able to conquer the temptation: But where ſinne hath dominion, there the ſinning comes from the heart, as a ſtreame from the fountaine: it is natural and not vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent: It is acted, not becauſe a man is not able to make ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient reſiſtance, but becauſe the heart is wholly ſet that way with fulleſt complacence.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, <hi>particular victory is a ſudden act, but dominion is</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Particular vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory is a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den act, but do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion is a more ſober work.</note> 
                           <hi>a more ſober work.</hi> In the one the ſoul is ſurpriſed, it is hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, it is precipitated, it is in a flame on a moment, a man hath not ſpace to weigh, to judge, to conſider; but ſinne hath with marvellous quickneſſe ſeized on the underſtanding, wrought upon the memory, ſtruck into the affections, and is
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:115641:83"/>
driven on in a raſh and paſſionate way: In the other the work is more ſober, not only actively deviſed, but affectionately adhered unto: a natural ſtrength of corrupt and living af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection makes the one; and in-advertency and raſhneſſe may be ſufficient to cauſe the other that ariſeth for want of watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe (as a Camp may be ſo ſurpriſed by an enemy) this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſeth out of a ſworn obedience, as the ſouldier follows his Captaine.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, <hi>Where the ſinning owes it ſelf, not to Dominion,</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Where there is no dominion but victory, the perſon feels the yoke and would ſhake it off.</note> 
                           <hi>but to particular victory, or tyranny, there the perſon, when he comes to himſelf, feeles the yoke, and would ſhake it off:</hi> It is true, that while the heat of corruption remains, and the force of temptation, yet diſables the heart to recollect it ſelf, it is moſt difficult for any perſon to diſtinguiſh; neither is he then come to ſcruple and queſtion: But when things grow clearer in the judgement, and more calme in the affections, when the hurry and tempeſt is off; that a man beholds his own face, and wayes, and actions in a right glaſſe again. Now it will quickly appeare, whether it be tyranny or Dominion. If it be but a tyrannical victory, Ah! how the ſoul loathes it ſelf; how it abominates the ſinner, like a man captivated, and rowing as a forced ſlave, in the Gally, he would cut the throat of the Maſter; or like a man in Priſon, he would make his eſcape with the death of him, who was too ſtrong to keep him. But if it be Dominion, then a man will not only ſerve his Maſter, but plead for him, he deſires not to eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape, he loves his Maſter, and would dwell with him for ever.</p>
                        <p>4. Therefore in the fourth place, if it be but <hi>victory,</hi> the <note place="margin">If it be but a victory, the perſon is work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to recover himſelf.</note> perſon is not only troubled at his fall, not only loathing of the actions, but he <hi>is actively working, he is uſing his vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorious weapons, to raiſe up himſelfe, to free himſelf again;</hi> he is grieved at the bondage, deſires liberty, and will fight hard for it: O the humblings, and prayings, and workings, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications of the ſoul to the ſword of the ſpirit, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination of the helps of ſinne, the contentions with the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of luſt, the watchings, the meditations, &amp;c. which ſuch an heart will uſe: But where it is dominion, the ſinne is
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:115641:83"/>
committed with joy, and the ſinner would continue with it in peace.</p>
                        <p>It is granted that there may be (ſometimes) ſome diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per in ſuch a heart, both before the ſinning, and after the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, but that before the ſinning is raiſed only upon carnal grounds, becauſe of ſubſequent ſhame, loſſe, prejudice, and that after the ſinning is only judicial, juſt throwes of an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſing conſcience, of which when the vile ſlave of ſin hath got free, when the cry of the world is off, and when the cry of his conſcience is down, he prepares his heart again for the ſinne, is ſad and heavy, untill he returnes to his vomit and mire: the work goes on againe as freely and as heartily as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.</p>
                        <p>Laſtly, if it <hi>be but particular victory the ſoul will riſe again,</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">In particular victory the ſoul will riſe again and not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out revenge.</note> 
                           <hi>and it will not riſe without revenge;</hi> Though the enemy hath got the battel, yet he ſhal looſe the battel: before the vanquiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſoul hath done, it will not only riſe, but fight, a naked com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate ſhall not ſuffice, but aſſault and purſuit; it will work with the art of holy ſtrength to the more deadly offence of that particular corruption.</p>

Yet there is a more difficult caſe, then any which <note place="margin">Doubt from the renued act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of ſinne.</note> hath been already propoſed, and <hi>that is renewed actings of the ſame ſinne:</hi> the perſon falls into the ſame ſinne again and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, and this repetition of ſinful acting, ſeems to be ſinne in cuſtome, and ſinne in cuſtome is ſinne in dominion; thus is it with me, or hath it been with me (doth ſome troubled ſoul) reply, and therefore my caſe is miſerable.</p>

Now a man ſinnes againſt all the workings of grace, ſo that God may bring forth all the former acts of the ſoule, and ſet them againſt the thus ſinning perſon: Look thou, here are the wounds which thou didſt make heretofore; and yet thou ſtrikes into the ſame again. Here are the teares which thou didſt ſhed for this ſinning heretofore; and yet thou wilt provoke me againe; here are the ſighs which thy heart did break out, here are the fears which did diſtreſſe and perplex thy ſoul, here are the prayers which thou didſt make for my tender mercies, here are the Covenants wherewith thou didſt binde thy ſoul, here are the Chapters which thou didſt read, to ſupport thee, here is the place where thou didſt power forththy anguiſhed heart in faſting and crying, here is that goodneſſe, and gracious love of mine, whereby I did accept of thee, upon thy humbling teares, into favour a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine; here is that peace, which I did thereupon create, and command into thy conſcience, here is that word which thou dideſt ſay, ſhould guide and rule thee for the time to come; here is that ſpirit which I ſent to raiſe thee againe.

                        <p>Firſt, in regard of the eminent propriety which it hath in perſons who do thus ſinne generally (though not abſolutely and ſimply) three ſorts of perſons run on in the frequent and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold actings of great ſins, <hi>viz.</hi> Such as are <hi>notoriouſly profane,</hi> ſuch as are <hi>cloſely hypocritical;</hi> ſuch as are <hi>deſpitefully oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the ſpirit of grace;</hi> theſe are they who grow from evil to worſe, and adde ſinne to ſinne, and make and fill up the meaſures of their particular iniquities which muſt needs ſtagger any ſoul, though perhaps not yet runne on ſo far as they, if yet repeating ſteps in the ſame paths, which the vileſt of ſinners have trod in before it.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, in regard of that dark and rare exemplarity of ſuch kindes of ſinning, by any, in Scripture canonized for Saints or godly perſons: it is eaſily admitted, that you may eſpy, upon ſome of the beſt, ſomething of the worſt: and perhaps thickly heaped, upon the ſame ſudden paſſion and temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but you ſhall rarely finde any one of them often at the ſame foule tranſgreſſion, I ſay, you ſhall rarely finde it.</p>

It is thus with ſinful acts flowing out of Cuſtome, they come from the heart as waters from a ſpring, and riſe from it as ſparks from the fire, O how nimble, and dextrous, and quick is the ſinner to ſin, you need not tempt him, he can tempt himſelf; you need not uſe arguments to perſwade and entiſe him, the accuſtomed drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kard knows the way, alone, to the Cup-houſe, and the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous heart to unlawful methods of gain; <hi>Balaam</hi> can quickly get on horſe-back for moneys ſake, to curſe <hi>Iſrael;</hi> and <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi> needs no meſſenger, he can go himſelf to the High-Prieſt: But when the renued acts depend rather on tyranny then cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom, there they come off more hardly with more difficulty, the ſin is marred (perhaps many times before it is done, the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſees it is vile and reſiſts it, then the pleaſure and profit tempts him, to which he begins to hearken, but preſently his heart miſgives him it is not right, and it will end in bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, he prays and yet is tempted, fights and yet is tempted, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts and yet is vanquiſhed.</p>

                        <p>You remember that I diſtinguiſhed heretofore of a two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold Dominion of ſin, one was natural, under which every man is held before his converſion: Another was actual which conſiſted in a particular prevalency, even upon a man con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted and changed: According to either there muſt be diſtinct Directions;</p>
                        <div type="subsection">
                           <head>1. Againſt <hi>Natural Dominion.</hi>

                           <p>For this we muſt conſider two things.</p>
                           <p>Firſt, what keeps and ſtrengthens that Dominion.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, what may demoliſh and ſubdue it: and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly apply our ſelves.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Queſt.</hi> 1. For the firſt let us enquire what <hi>keeps up and ſtrengthens the natural dominion of ſin,</hi> and accordingly work a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <note place="margin">What ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens naturall do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion, worke againſt that. Ignorance.</note> it.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Sol.</hi> There are four things which do it.</p>
                           <p>1. One is <hi>ignorance:</hi> The blindneſſe of the underſtanding is a principal guard of reigning ſinne: you reade that they in <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 19. <hi>Gave themſelves over unto laſciviouſneſſe to work all uncleanneſſe with greedineſs;</hi> like a ſouldier, who gives himſelf up, and takes pay, or like a ſervant who paſſeth away himſelf to ſervice; ſo theſe reſigned up their hearts and lives to all uncleanneſs; it was their delight, it was their work, (this ſhewed the dominion of ſin) But what was the cauſe of this: See <hi>v.</hi> 18. <hi>Their underſtandings were darkned, through the ignorance that was in them, becauſe of the blindneſs of their hearts:</hi> The ignorance of ſinne kept up their earneſtneſſe and practice of ſinning. If ignorance rules the minde, then ſinne will eaſily rule the heart: all ſinful dominion is enabled by ignorance: <hi>The Devil is a Prince of darkneſſe,</hi> and takes
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:115641:87"/>
ſpeciall care to keep men blinde: <hi>Antichrist is a ſonne of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> and therefore above all, ſets up his kingdome by igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance: So is it with ſin it ſelfe, its dominion is mantained by blindneſſe in the minde; and therefore ſin in unconverted men, makes the mighty oppoſition againſt the word, and the meanes of knowledge: it knows well that no man turnes from ſin who doth not diſcerne it, nor hates it, who knowes it not: The priſoner is ſure enough under a locke, and in the dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon.</p>
                           <p>Now then if ever you would get off this natural dominion of ſinne, you muſt get knowledge, a double knowledge in the minde.</p>
                           <p>1. One <hi>direct,</hi> and that is a diſtinct and true apprehenſion of ſin, juſt as the Lord reveals it to be, both for its proper na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and genuine affects.</p>
                           <p>2. Another is <hi>Reflexive:</hi> that is ſinfulneſſe, (which God hath revealed to be ſo vile, ſo abominable, ſo fearfull) It is in you, and it is working in you; you are under the powers of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, you muſt come to your ſelves, you muſt fetch your ſouls unto your ſouls, if you wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>l not get a ſenſibleneſs of ſin, (and that is begun by knowledge) you will live and die in your ſins.</p>
                           <p>A Second thing which keeps up the naturall dominion of ſin, is <hi>a violent love of ſin:</hi> Love is the ſinew of the heart, yea it is the chaire of ſtate, whatſoever ſits in it, that is the King of the <note place="margin">Violent love of ſin.</note> ſoule, whether grace or ſin: For love doth beſtow the heart, what our love is that our heart is, it makes all to ſtoop, and yield: There is no talke of parting, while love remaines; <hi>I will not goe free</hi> (ſaid the <hi>Hebrew ſervant)</hi> for I love my maſter Why? the ſoule and ſin are in a ſworne covenant (like <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Jonathan)</hi> if the ſoule doth love ſin, untill you take off the love, you ſhall never be able to take downe the domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</p>
                           <p>Therefore, this ſhall be another direction, break downe the love of ſin.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Ob.</hi> But how ſhould that be done?</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Sol.</hi> Firſt, convince the heart, that ſin is no lovely thing; There be three things which ſhould not fall under our love.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="165" facs="tcp:115641:87"/>
1. That which is the object of Gods hatred, No man may love that which God hates.</p>
                           <p>2. That which is the object of Gods curſe: that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be good which he curſeth, and therefore not love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
                           <p>3. That which is the cauſe of mans damnation and miſery, for no man is to love the cauſe of his undoing: Now ſin is the only thing which God hates, and which God curſeth, and which will damn a man.</p>
                           <p>2. Give to thy ſoule a ſolid and full object of love, finde out ſomething which thou ſhouldeſt love; Is there not a God, a Chriſt, an Holy ſpirit, <hi>His</hi> word, heaven, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> There is no love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs in ſin, and all lovelineſs in theſe things</p>
                           <p>3. Another thing which keeps up the dominion of ſin is <hi>er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror</hi> 
                              <note place="margin">Error and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit.</note> 
                              <hi>and deceit,</hi> there is a lye in every ſin, and the judgement is deceived where the ſin is retained, either a man thinkes he ſins not, but is eſcaped out of the hands of luſt, or that his condition is ſound and good; or if it be bad, yet not ſo bad as others; or if very bad, yet he can at pleaſure releaſe himſelfe; and thus through a vaine fancy, he continues under the bondage of his corruptions: And ſo for the actions of ſin, he deceives his ſoul, he doth not behold them in a compariſon to the rule, he doth not judge of them by the word, but in a reference to his owne corrupt deſires and delights, which ſwallow downe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite ſins, ſugared over by pleaſure and profit.</p>
                           <p>Now if ever you would get free from ſin, get your judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to be cured: a ſound judgement may be a good meanes <label type="milestone">
                                 <seg type="milestoneunit">Note. </seg>
                              </label> to breed a ſound heart; thou wilt never be perſwaded to be good, untill the erroneous confidence that thou art not bad be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved: convince thy minde of theſe truths againſt all errors, that indeed thou art ſinfull. And that no ſin is little in its me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and it is not, what is leaſt wicked, but he who is really good, ſhall be ſaved: Do not judge of acceptance or diſac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance by ſenſible pleaſures, or profits; but beyond theſe, look what that is which is ſo coloured and diſguiſed, it is even a ſnare for thy life, and that which hunts for the precious ſoule.</p>
                           <p>4. A fourth thing which keeps up dominion is <hi>cuſtome:</hi> the
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:115641:88"/>
heart by cuſtomary ſinning grows ſtrong in ſin, and reſolute and <note place="margin">Cuſtome.</note> is by often committings made more naturally ſinful, and more apt for further ſinfull actions.</p>
                           <p>Now obſerve a little, Give ſome checks to the ordinary <label type="milestone">
                                 <seg type="milestoneunit">Ob. </seg>

                           </p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Ob.</hi> But if it were done, this were vaine and fruitleſſe, for the dominion of ſin Subſiſts in the nature, Though manifeſted in the acts.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Sol.</hi> I grant it, yet firſt If the heart be brought to ſet againſt the ſinfull acts, it may be brought to ſet againſt the ſinfull nature, ſecondly, The abating of the acts, may virtually conduce to the abating of that ſinfull nature. <note place="margin">What may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moliſh the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſin.</note>
                           </p>
                           <p>

                              <hi>Sol.</hi> I will Tell you a few things for this, and I pray you to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member them: <note place="margin">That which doth this muſt have a greater power then ſin.</note>
                           </p>
                           <p n="1">1. That which doth this, <hi>it muſt have a greater power then ſin,</hi> for naturall dominion goes not of but by a ſtronger hand: Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan is not diſpoſſeſſed but by a ſtronger then Satan: And we are not tranſlated from the powers of darkneſſe, but by an hand of omnipotency. <note place="margin">It muſt be of a contrary nature unto ſin.</note>

                           <p>Now then the directions are theſe?</p>
                           <p>1. If ever thou wouldeſt get down the dominion of ſin, <hi>thou</hi>
                              <pb n="168" facs="tcp:115641:88"/>

As <hi>Jehoſaphat</hi> ſpake againſt thoſe ſtrong armies, <hi>we know not what to doe: yet our eyes are upon thee;</hi> ſoe in the ſenſe of thy naturall vileneſs and ſinfull dominion, O Lord I am bound, I am in bondage, I am dead in ſins, Lord I am unable to eſcape, but thou art able to deliver, O deliver my ſoule for thy mercies ſake, and ſubdue mine iniquities, and ſhew forth thy power, &amp;c: <hi>who ſhall deliver me, I thanke God through Jeſus Christ,</hi> Rom. 7. 24, 25.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, becauſe meer power doth not do it, but power in a quality, working through ſome quality, Therefore <hi>beg of</hi>

                              <hi>God, that he would give thee the grace of his ſpirit,</hi> it is true, that naked power takes not off the ſinfull dominion: nor doth the quality alone doe it, but both can doe it: If God gives a man grace, and mightily aſiſts and workes by and through that grace; this now will beat downe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                           <p>The light, though it be but a little at firſt, yet aſiſted by a mighty principle of light ſhall conquer darkneſſe: pride will have dominion till humility comes in.</p>
                           <p>Now, then beg of God, for grace, for his holy ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, for another heart, for a new heart and a new ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</p>
                           <p>Thirdly, <hi>labour earneſtly for faith:</hi> if two things were done, <note place="margin">Labour for faith.</note> ſin could not poſſibly continue in dominion. <hi>viz.</hi>

heart and knits it with love to Chriſt again: Nay to add to all this, faith beſtowes the life on Chriſt too, <hi>He died for me, ſaid faith;</hi> I judge it therefore moſt reaſonable, that I ſhould live to him; Now where Chriſt comes to rule, and hath love and life, there ſinne without all doubt, looſeth its dominion.</p>
                           <p>4.

O no, thy life lies upon this, or thy death.</p>
                           <p>Therefore reſolve on it to ſet againſt thy ſins, ſay this with thy ſelfe, if I ſuffer ſin to rule thus I periſh, for ever, if I get off the dominion I live for ever, if I continue in this ſinfull e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, I muſt bid God farwell, and Chriſt farwell, and heaven; and all the comforts of my poor ſoul farwel: I confeſs I may get a little pleaſure by my ſins, &amp; a little profit by my ſins but I am not ſure to enjoy them one moment, and why ſhould I venture eternity of miſery for one draught of ſinful water: If I could get off ſins dominion, O what a God might I look on, plead with, ſue unto: what a Saviour ſhould I get? what precious joys? what hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly conſolations: what peace here? what hopes for hereafter? well, come of it what will, though I have been ſinful, I will not ſtill continue ſo, to God will I come, to Chriſt will I goe: I will beſeech them to have mercy upon me a ſinner, and to give me grace, and to change my heart, I will not ſerve my baſe luſts any longer, I will never leave praying, hearing, reading, ſtudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, inquiring, working, till I be delivered from this bondage, and tranſlated into the glorious liberty of the ſonnes of God? <note place="margin">Againſt actuall dominion.

                           </head>
                           <p>Thus for directions, Againſt the natural dominion of ſin: Now I proceed to ſome helpes againſt actual dominion, which
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:115641:89"/>
is the particular prevalency of a ſinne into act.</p>
                           <p>Let me premiſe a propoſition or two, and then you ſhall have the ſpecial directions themſelves.</p>
                           <p>1. <hi>Actual Dominion</hi> (I ſpeak in reſpect of groſſe acts) is <hi>uſually in respect of ſome particular luſts: which works with more ſtrength in the ſoul then any other luſts;</hi> Though it be moſt true, that in every man there is an univerſal root of ſinning, yet you finde it in experience that the multitudes of ſinful in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations, and thoughts and temptations, run ordinarily in ſome peculiar way, with moſt frequency and violence.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, <hi>actual Dominion is ordinarily by ſuch a ſin which hath the advantage of a natural complexion, and outward condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and occaſions, and affections,</hi> upon theſe doth ſinne ſet the temptation, as an Enginer doth place his battery upon ſuch a <note place="margin">Simile.</note> piece of ground, which doth beſt advantage and further his ſhot againſt a City.</p>
                           <p>A mans natural temper and complexion doth mightily faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litate his acts, and a mans calling or condition of life may (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidentally) be a forcible perſwaſion to him to much infidelity, and impatience, and indirectneſs: And occaſions in converſing actively or paſſively, have infinite baits in them, and when our affections may run in ſome lawful meaſure and manner, there ſin takes occaſion to tempt and prevaile with eaſe; if we look not to it, he may quickly be caſt down by a ſinful temptation, who is already prepared thereunto by a ſinful faction.</p>
                           <p>Therefore if ever you would keep off the prevalency of a particular ſin, obſerve diſtinctly, and work wiſely, againſt all the things which may advantage it in its temptations.</p>
                           <p>Thirdly, conſider that many things may keep back (for a while) the explicite actings of a particular ſinne, which yet are not able to weaken the natural power of the ſinful inclination.</p>
                           <p>There are two ſorts of principles (as it were) which have an influence upon a man: ſome are <hi>violent</hi> and <hi>forcible,</hi> which work by a ſtrong hand thus farre (ſometimes) prevailing, to hold back that a man dares not do ſuch an evil (as ſhame, love of a mans credit, quiet, profit and ſafety) and ſome are powerful too; but yet inwardly weakning the very nature and diſpoſition, as all ſorts of graces: Now then if ever you
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:115641:90"/>
would be throughly kept from the actual dominion of ſinne in groſs, do not content your ſelves with meerly forcible reſtraints, for as much as theſe may oft-times fail you, and then your hearts will deceive you; you will venture to foul iniquities, having nothing now within you of a contrary vertue: But above all be ſtriving for grace, which is contrary not only to the ſinful acts, but to the ſinful nature, which is the fountaine inclining the ſoul unto them; get chaſtity into the heart, and meekneſſe into the heart, and humbleneſſe into the heart, and ſoberneſſe into the heart, and heavenlineſs, and faith, &amp;c.</p>
                           <p>Fourthly, improve that ſtrength which God hath given unto thee every way.</p>
                           <p>Though this be rrue, that a man by his natural ſtrength can never change his ſinful nature, yet aſſuredly he may do much againſt ſinful acts; if that he would beſtir himſelf, why? is not a man able to deny his eye a look, or his tongue a word, and his feet a walk? you know this, that ſin is ſet on fire by occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and by many things which lie directly under our power? and it may be much ſtaid by the doing of many things which we are able to do. If a man will let his eyes ſtill roule upon vaine objects, whereas (if he would) he might check their motion, no marvel if his heart be ſtill ſet on fire by luſt, and if he will aſſociate himſelf with perſons provoking him to filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and drunkenneſſe, (whereas if he would, he might decline that ſociety) who can think it ſtrange that ſuch ſins ſhould have actual dominion over him. If thou wilt thou mayeſt read, and hear, and apply thy ſelf to all the means by which grace may be wrought, and ſin ſubdued, and if thou didſt ſo, what canſt thou tell what God may do for thy ſoul.</p>
                           <p>Nay, let me tell you more, that a man who hath received grace, (and therefore more power then a natural man) if he will not improve his ſtrength, he ſhall hardly keep off the actual dominion of ſome one ſin or other; if he will not decline that which he ſhould and may, and if he will not do that which he ſhould and can, it is not his naked praying that will keep him up: Prayer (without all queſtion, as you ſhall hear by and by) is of ſingular force and uſe againſt the preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:115641:90"/>
of all corruptions, but we muſt not reſt only upon the prayer, but pray and work, pray and forbear, pray and deny our ſelves, pray and ſhunne occaſions, pray and follow our help, &amp;c.</p>
                           <p>Now I come unto ſome <hi>ſpeciall directions</hi> againſt the actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al <note place="margin">Special directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> dominion of a particular luſt.</p>
                           <p>Foure ſpecial Directions.</p>
                           <p>Firſt, <hi>preſerve in thy ſoul a conſtant and humble feare,</hi> and <note place="margin">Preſerve in the ſoul a conſtant and humble fear.</note> that will keep off the actual dominion of thy ſinne. Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber <hi>Solomons</hi> advice, <hi>Bleſſed is the man that feareth alwayes,</hi> Prov. 28. 14. And Gods promiſe, <hi>I will put my feare within them, and they ſhall not depart from me,</hi> Jerem. 41. <hi>q. d.</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this you are gone, you will quickly looſe your ſtanding, if you looſe your fear.</p>
                           <p>There be ſome graces which are as it were the guard of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther graces: look as <hi>faith</hi> is a grace which feeds all the reſt: So feare is a grace which keepes all the reſt. This ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and humble feare hath theſe properties (all which ſtrengthen the ſoule againſt actual dominion of ſinne) It hath God <hi>ſtill in eye;</hi> it ſets a man and his ways, and acts in the preſence of an holy and glorious God: Now ſaith <hi>Joſeph, how can I do this great evil and ſin againſt God,</hi> Gen. 39.</p>
                           <p>Again, it <hi>prefers Gods pleaſure and Gods frown above all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging or diſcouraging temptations;</hi> yea, but I muſt do this, for God requires it, and delights in it; yea, but I may not do this, for God hates it, and will be provoked by it; I prefer his favour above all falſe honour and pleaſure, and I account his frownes worſe then death it ſelf. Now if I ſhould thus ſin, why? I provoke his wrath, and provoke the Lord to jealouſie, I cauſe him to riſe in diſpleaſure againſt me, <hi>i. e.</hi> why? how would the Lord take it, if I ſhould thus ſinne.</p>
                           <p>2. <hi>Get a ſound and uncorrupt judgement:</hi> there be three <note place="margin">Get a ſound judgement.</note> caſes in which a man is apt to fall under the actual domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſinne, and corruption of judgement is a maine cauſe of them.</p>
                           <p>One is, when he thinks or ſayes <hi>that the ſin is little.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Another is, when he ſaith, <hi>that his own ſtrength is great.</hi>

A third is, when he aſſures himſelf <hi>of eaſie pardon and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery:</hi> ſinne uſually is a cloud, and then a ſhower, a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption in the judgement before a victory in the affections: a man will quickly tremble under the guilt of ſome great commiſſion, who hath dallied with little ſinnes, or with the opinion that they are ſo: And he who ventures farre unto any occaſions, upon his own ſtrength, that man bids faire for ſome foule fact, under which he ſhortly falls, if God ſhew him not the vanity of his ſelf-confidence: And ſo is he ready, very ready for a groſſe tranſgreſſion, who hath ſecured his ſoul al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready for his pardon: what ſin will he ſtick at, who hath per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded himſelf, that the pardon is already granted, although he preſume to ſin.</p>
                           <p>Now cleanſe the judgement of theſe corrupt principles and believe it.</p>
                           <p>1. <hi>That no ſinne is little:</hi> That muſt needs be great which <note place="margin">Believe that no ſin is little.</note> provokes a great God, and endangereth a precious ſoule; he who is brought to ſuch an holy tenderneſſe, that he ſees greatneſſe of guilt in littleneſs of ſinning, ſhall by Gods grace be kept from the dominion of any ſinne: Every ſinne (even the leaſt) is a foul ſpot: And is the object of divine hatred and curſe, it may prove like a little ſpark to conſume an houſe, or like a little leake ſufficient to drown a ſhip; or like a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle thruſt into the heart, enough to loſe a man his life.</p>
                           <p>2. That <hi>your own ſtrength is not ſufficient:</hi> even the ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt <note place="margin">And that your own ſtrength is not ſufficient</note> ſhip left to it ſelf cannot venture far, but it is upon rocks or ſands: Any thing may prove too ſtrong for him, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives himſelf too ſtrong for any thing.</p>
                           <p>He that will venture upon ſinful provocations, and occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, diſarms his ſoul, and lays his very heart naked to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt: A Chriſtian may do very much in good wayes, which have Gods warrant to lead him, and Gods promiſe to keep him, but if he alone will be preſuming, as the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> who would go up to fight upon their own humour, fell and loſt, ſo ſhall a man preſently learne his owne weakneſſe by the ſtrength of ſinnes ſurpriſal; many a man hath been ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually wounded, not becauſe he had no grace, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:115641:92"/>
he would adventure upon the ſtrength of it without any ſecurity from God.</p>
                           <p>3. <hi>That pardon is not ſo eaſily obtained;</hi> Nor the ſoul ſo <note place="margin">And that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don is not eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obtained.</note> quickly recovered after particular dominions.</p>
                           <p>It is an eaſie thing to ſlip into ſinne, it is difficult to get out of it: a little thing will ſerve to diſtemper our health, and yet much Phyſick is required to ſet the humours ſtreight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain: All entrances to ſinne are with the greater facility; for then temptations and carnal affections blinde our judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, but the recoveries are the harder; for now the vile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and hainouſneſſe of the ſinning appears more diſtinctly, and the conſcience works more ſharply and vehemently, and our very graces are the more diſabled.</p>
                           <p>Aſſuredly, if you will venture to ſinne, you loſe a friend of God, and encouragement in conſcience, and ſtrength in your ſoules; this very conceit that thou ſhouldeſt eaſily make thy peace with God and finde mercy (though thou didſt ſin) I ſay this very conceit will mightily afflict thy ſoul, and aggravate thy tranſgreſſion, when thou beholds thy ſoul in blood for ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings; mercy is the moſt ſingular ground of repentance; and nothing ſtings us more for ſinning then this, that we abuſed mercies to invite us: Therefore when ſin tempts thee, reſiſt it, yeeld not to it, ſay thus who would adventure the ſweet mercies of a gracious God, to ſatisfie the luſts of a damnable ſin, and why ſhould I be ſo mad? having health to make my ſelf ſick, to break the bones which yet are whole; to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſettle the peace of my conſcience, to weaken my graces, to diſ-joynt my eſtate: If as now I am, I have much to do; ah, what folly is it to make more woful work for my ſoul?

thod to prepare the ſoul, and then on a ſudden they vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently ſurpriſe it.</p>
                           <p>There are theſe methods.</p>
                           <p>Firſt, perhaps <hi>naked motions,</hi> the vile heart gives up only a ſhew of a particular ſin, in an imagination our thought preſents the kinds of ſinnin, and ſo falls in again.</p>
                           <p>Then perhaps a <hi>careleſs uſe of our ſenſes,</hi> which wandring (without regard) light upon ſome object which fits the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ſinful motions, and ſtrongly inlivens them.</p>
                           <p>After this <hi>active contemplation</hi> of theſe ſinful motions, not to deteſt and bewaile them, but to look upon them in an idle way.</p>
                           <p>After this a <hi>meditation of them,</hi> which is a more deliberate entertainment of them, which now riſeth to a kind of treaty in the minde, where the ſinful motion craves entertainment, by arguments of profit, or pleaſure on credit, then a darting <hi>down to the affections</hi> to hearken and delight.</p>
                           <p>Then upon the next occaſion, an <hi>acting of all this ſinful</hi> imagination and plot.</p>
                           <p>Brethren if you love your ſouls take off ſinnes in their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trances, before they gather head; if a man could keep ſinne from pleading, he might, keep himſelf from acting<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Break the egg, and you need not feare the flying of the bird: Cruſh <note place="margin">Simile.</note> ſinne in motion, and it is a clear way to prevent ſin in domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion: The match will never be made, if all treaties be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected: little motions are the principles of great ſinnes, as ſprings of rivers, and ſparks of flames. Therefore, let us this do, reſiſt motions to ſin as a man ſhould reſiſt the actings of ſin: do not ſay, it is but a thought, <hi>Jehues</hi> army came af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the ſcouts: Great ſinning may attend little and flattered imaginations, he who ſlights inward thoughts, and is careleſs of his outward ſenſes, is in a faire way to become a great ſinner. <note place="margin">Sue out your ſtanding by by prayer and faith.</note>
                           </p>
                           <p>Fourthly, <hi>ſue out your ſtanding by prayer and faith:</hi> I will tell you two things.</p>
                           <p>1. That the ſtrongeſt grace cannot free us from the fier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſt aſſaults: even the beſt heart, and moſt eminent Chriſtian is expoſed to the fouleſt and moſt violent temptations of ſin and Satan.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="175" facs="tcp:115641:93"/>
2. That this reſiſting ſtrength which keeps ſin from domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, is in God, and not in himſelf: As that we become good, is from the goodneſſe of Gods grace; ſo that we prove not bad, is from the greatneſſe of Gods power: no man is able to change his own heart, nor is his heart his own guard.</p>
                           <p>Therefore under all temptations, be at prayer and faith: Theſe are the two wings of the ſoul, &amp;c. Some victories are beſt had by ſtanding up, but that againſt ſin is ſureſt by kneeling down: O when the heart is much in prayer, it is then moſt in ſtrength; prayer engageth all heaven againſt a corruption: And God hath promiſed to <hi>ſubdue iniquities,</hi> and that <hi>ſin ſhall not have dominion,</hi> Rom. 6. 14. Now what he hath promiſed, that he is able to perform, and will if we can pray and believe. We give ſinne the great advantage, when we ſlack our prayers and lay aſide our faith.</p>
                           <p>It is the wiſeſt art of a tempted ſoul to decline all occaſions, to be under prevailing Ordinances, and to uſe prayer, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe faith according to the nature, kind and meaſure of ſinful motions and inclinations.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>There are two ſorts of perſons, hypocrites and upright perſons, and the Scripture opens them by their hearts.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Hypocrites</hi> are ſaid to have <hi>an heart and an heart,</hi> Pſal. 12. 2. <hi>with a double heart do they ſpeak,</hi> in the original it is, with an heart and an heart, So <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 10. 2. <hi>their heart is divided, now ſhall they be found faulty:</hi> and therefore, <hi>James</hi> 1. 8. they are called <hi>men of two mindes, double-minded men;</hi> they are in ſome things for God, and in moſt things for themſelves; now for his ſervice and anon for their luſts; look as hypocriſie min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles ſinne and the affection together, ſo it mingles God, and ſin, and the world together, it doth not look on God for Gods ſake, but for profits ſake, or pleaſures ſake, or honours ſake; On the contrary, <hi>upright perſons are perſons of one heart,</hi> or of a ſingle heart: as the <hi>Zebulonites</hi> are ſaid, <hi>not to be of a double heart,</hi> 1 Chron. 12. 33. which is expound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>v.</hi> 38. <hi>by a perfect heart:</hi> A mans heart is upright when God alone, and his ways alone, and his truth alone, ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie, and order, and bound it; when a man can ſay in truth, as they in the matter of Choice, <hi>Nay, but the Lord is our God, him will we ſerve.</hi> I have choſen the Lord to be my God, and his truths to be my guide, and his precepts to be my paths, and his glory to be my end, and hereto only will I ſtick, when the ſoul doth not halt between two, or divides it ſelf in a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of any ſide or way, but keeps only to God.</p>
                        <p>Sometimes it is called <hi>perfection:</hi> and the upright are called perfect: as <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 1. <hi>Walk before me and be thou perfect,</hi> Deut. 18. 13. <hi>Thou ſhalt be perfect with the Lord thy God,</hi> Pſalme 37. 37. <hi>Mark the perfect man, and behold the upright.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>There is a double perfection:</p>
                        <p>One <hi>Abſolute,</hi> in reſpect of degrees (which no man can now attain unto in this life, no not the moſt upright: <hi>for in many things we offend all.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The other <hi>Evangelical,</hi> which conſiſts in the evenneſſe of deſire and endeavour: when a man ſets up and exalts the word of God, and ſtrives to ſquare his heart and his life in all things thereby.</p>

                        <p>Sometimes it is called <hi>a ſpirit without guile,</hi> ſo, <hi>Pſal</hi> 32. 2. <hi>Bleſſed is the man in whoſe ſpirit there is no guile,</hi> and <hi>Chriſt</hi> of <hi>Nathaniel,</hi> Joh. 1. 47. <hi>Behold an Iſraelite indeed, in whom is no guile.</hi> An hypocritical heart is a cunning heart, it hath many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſes, ſhufflings, windings, and turnings, this heart is not plain and ſound: Therefore the hypocrites are ſaid to have <hi>corrupt thoughts, and to flatter with their tongu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Now on the contrary, an upright heart is without guile, it is even plain and down-right, therefore is it in the parable called an <hi>honeſt heart,</hi> and ſaith <hi>Paul, we ſpeak the truth in Chriſt;</hi> and upright walking is ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a walking <hi>in truth,</hi> and ſerving of God in truth and in ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; The meaning is this, that the upright man is indeed that which he profeſſeth: his life and profeſſion is not a painting which owes it ſelf to an Artificer, but a natural colour which owes it ſelf to the ſoundneſſe of temper: he is one who hath <hi>truth in the inward parts</hi> (as <hi>David</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51. 6.) He doth without baſe ends directly love God, and from his very heart hate ſinne. Though he cannot expreſſe himſelf in that flouriſh of formality, yet for Chriſt, he can plainly ſay as <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, Lord thou knoweſt all things, thou knoweſt that I love thee;</hi> And touching ſinnes, as <hi>David</hi> of Gods enemies, <hi>I hate them with a perfect hatred:</hi> this he is in good earneſt.</p>
                        <p>Sometimes it is called the <hi>allneſſe,</hi> or <hi>whollineſſe of heart,</hi> ſo <hi>Deut.</hi> 4. 29. <hi>If thou ſeek him with all thine heart,</hi> Deut. 26. 16. <hi>Thou ſhalt keep and do them with all thine heart, and with</hi>

There be other phraſes to ſet out this buſineſſe of uprightneſſe, but I muſt paſſe them over, and pitch upon the deſcription.</p>
                        <p>2. Now to the ſecond <hi>quid Rei,</hi> I conjecture that upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe <note place="margin">The deſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</note> may be thus deſcribed.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Uprightneſs is a ſound and heavenly frame or temper of a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious heart or ſpirit given by God, by which graces are acted, ſinnes are oppoſed, duties are performed affectionate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, directly and plainly, In reference to God, and not for by-reſpects.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I will briefly open this deſcription in its particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars.</p>
                        <p>Firſt, it is the temper or frame of the heart: The ſeat of up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightneſſe <note place="margin">The ſeat of it is their heart.</note> is the heart or ſpirit: hence is it ſtiled <hi>uprightneſſe of heart,</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 3. 6. <hi>Thou haſt ſhewed unto<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> thy ſervant David my father great mercies, according as he walked before thee in truth, in righteouſneſſe, and in uprightneſs of heart:</hi> So 'tis ſtiled <hi>ſingleneſſe of heart,</hi> Act. 2. 46. and <hi>Truth in the inward parts,</hi> Pſal. 51. 6. and <hi>a ſervice in ſpirit,</hi> Rom. 1. 9. <hi>God is my witneſs whom I ſerve with my ſpirit in the Goſpel of his Sonne. Hypocriſie</hi> is a colour but skin deep; A painting which lies only upon the ſuperficies or ſurface of the wall, upon the viſibles or outwards of profeſſion or action: but <hi>uprightneſs,</hi> like health, it is an inward <hi>criſis</hi> or temperature; as the conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation renders it ſelf to the eye of man, ſo the inward diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſtrives to render it ſelf to the eye of Gods approbation; if a man be upright, it is with him as with <hi>Solomons Temple,</hi> though the outward parts were comely, and uniform; yet the inſide was covered with the moſt precious gold, and had the ſweeteſt incenſe.</p>
                        <p>All counterfeit things are beſt in their ſhew, and worſt in
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:115641:97"/>
their ſubſtance and vertue: But uprightneſſe is beſt there where leaſt can be ſeen: The actions are nothing to the Inward affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and deſires.</p>
                        <p>We do but as the Queen of <hi>Sheba,</hi> here, no not halfe of the goodneſſe of an upright man by what he doth, if you would but look into his heart and converſe with him there a while, you ſhould find, the heart, the diſpoſition, the deſire of his ſoul, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely to exceed all that he doth, Pſal. 119. <hi>O how I love thy law, O that my ways were ſo direct?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The heart oftimes mournes, when the eyes can ſhed no teares, and the heart believes, when the tongue cannot ſpeake much faith, and the inward man (the heart) would doe that and much more, then what is done or performed.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, it <hi>is a temper or frame of the heart,</hi> a compoſition: <note place="margin">It is the temper and frame of the heart. It is not a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle or tranſient act or motion.</note> as it were in which methinks, two things may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved.</p>
                        <p>1. One that <hi>uprightneſs is not a ſingle, or tranſient act or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi> I thinke that even an Hypocrite, whoſe heart is rotten, corrupt, falſe, abominable, may yet, as ſtep out into actions materially good, ſo feel motions within him both againſt what is evill, and unto what is good, he may (either through the force and power of evidence and conviction in his judgement, or through the unreſiſtable actions, of his inlighted and ſtirred conſcience, or through the great deſire, of a glorious bleſſedneſſe, have many fits and inward humours of being good and doing good.</p>
                        <p>But all this is paſſion and not temper: the Philoſopher In his Rhetoricks accurately diſtinguiſh twixt the readineſſe, which ſpringes out of a naturall complexion, and that which ariſeth out of a violent Anger and paſſion which ſoone fades off, being not rooted in nature, but in diſtemper: ſo is it whith the Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite. But uprightneſſe is a temper and frame, like an inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment well tuned, or if that hit not full, like a complexion, which is a uniform (if not principle yet) inſtrument of actions. It is like that <hi>leaven,</hi> of which Chriſt ſpake, which invades the whole lump, it ſweetly ſeaſons and diſpoſes the whole man for God, as the bent of the ſtone is to the center, and of the fire to aſcend.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="184" facs="tcp:115641:98"/>
Another, that <hi>uprightneſs is rather a generall Influence in</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">It is rather a general influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in the graces, then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny diſtinct grace.</note> 
                           <hi>the graces, then any diſtinct grace:</hi> I will not make this point a controverſy, only ſo far as I yet apprehend, uprightneſſe is rather the temper of a grace; then the grace it ſelfe; It is not feare, but feare rightly tempered and ordered, it is not love, but love rightly ſet; it is not deſire, but this orderly car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried.</p>
                        <p>3. It is a <hi>ſound and incorrupt and heavenly frame of</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">The qualities of it.</note> 
                           <hi>heart.</hi>

                        <p>1. A thing may be termed, <hi>ſound</hi> or ſolid, either when it is <note place="margin">Sound.</note> 
                           <hi>reall,</hi> not light, ſlight, ſuperficiall, or <hi>when it can abide triall:</hi> as true gold is Really ſo and not in colour only, and if you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce it to the touchſtone you ſhall finde it ſo: if you caſt it into the fire, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Thus it is with the heart that is upright, and it hath not a forme of <hi>Godlineſſe,</hi> but the <hi>power;</hi> and not a name that it lives, but the life it ſelfe: it is (indeed) holy, humble, meeke, believing, loving of God and his ſervants, deſirous to walke with God, Pſal. 116. 160. <hi>Lord truly I am thy ſervant,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>q. d.</hi> I am ſo indeed: this is not a complement, a garb, a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence but a reallity, ſoe is it with the man indeed: <hi>an Iſraelite indeed,</hi> ſaid Chriſt of <hi>Nathaniell, Joh.</hi> 1. 47.

                        <p>Beſides this, if we did but ſeriouſly obſerve and confeſſe how it is in our own ſpirits, we ſhould finde in all our pious pretences (take us in our naturalls) we are all of us moſt formall and Artificiall hypocrites: <hi>Draw neare to God with our lips, but our hearts are far from him,</hi> and come to Church when we minde neither prayer nor Sermon, and liſten oftimes, and (God knows) not to obey but to cenſure, or but to get matter to talk of and the like: and when we have got ability to ſpeake of any good, the Lord be mercifull unto us, we do it not minding Gods glory, but our owne vaine applauſe and eſtimation; Soe then the hypocricall heart is from our ſelves, but the upright heart is from God; <hi>Every good and perfect gift is from above,</hi> James 1. 18. The perfect heart is from the perfect God, the true heart from the God of truth; It is he who teacheth truth, and makes upright, and writes his law in the inward parts.</p>
                        <p>5. The fifth thing which I would obſerve in uprightneſſe, is its <hi>office of adminiſtration,</hi> it is ſuch a thing as deales, 1. <hi>about gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</hi>

                        <p>1. <hi>For our graces]</hi> uprightneſſe lookes to them that they be rightly acted: Beloved, uprightneſſe doth not give grace: <note place="margin">It deals about graces.</note> but orders and directs the acts and operations thereof.</p>
                        <p>Two things I grant! that <hi>all the habits of grace</hi> (are in themſelves intrinſecally conſidered) <hi>really true;</hi> and though imperfection may be in them, yet no morall falſity or coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeitneſs: and <hi>that the actions of thoſe holy habits,</hi> conſidered intirely as ſtreaming from them (only as ſo) are likewiſe <hi>truly holy, and good.</hi>
                        </p>

But then, theſe acts or actions of gracious habits as working in a ſubject which hath ſome falſneſſe and byneſſe yet remaining, may by reaſon of that corruption be miſdirected &amp; miſguided.</p>
                        <p>3. For hypocriſie doth not only conſiſt in the putting of a good ſhape upon an evill action (as a faire colour upon a rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten thred) but alſo in the ill intention or application even of an act (in it ſelfe) truly good. Charity (without all doubt) is a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious quallity, yet if uprightneſſe attends not ſome of it acts, they may be referred to a private and vaine glorious end, the like may be ſaid of ſome other graces, as of the love of God, and the feare of God, &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>2 <hi>For ſins)</hi> here alſo uprightneſſe comes into act it ſelfe: ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe (which is nothing elſe but the newneſſe of Nature) that makes oppoſition to ſin, But uprightneſſe, that now is an even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe <note place="margin">For our ſins.</note> or impartiality of oppoſition.</p>
                        <p>To oppoſe a little ſin, and yet to cloſe with a great ſin, to oppoſe many ſins, and yet to hold a knowne and a willing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federacy with any one, to oppoſe ſin in others, and yet to act it our ſelves, to oppoſe ſin as open to the eye of man, and yet to fall to it in ſecret, where it is naked to the eye of God; To oppoſe a ſin to which conſtitution and age deny concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of delight or ſtrength, and yet to wallow in others agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to our complexions, conditions, and yeares; to oppoſe the unprofitable ſin, which brings nothing in but paine, and yet to admit of gainfull ſins, which come with rewards of divina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in their hands, to oppoſe any ſin, only becauſe it is paineful, and not becauſe it is ſinfull; To oppoſe ſin in our ſtraits, and not in our liberties, in ſickneſſe, and not in health, when only we feare death and not at all under life and ſtrength; I ſay all theſe are but hypocriſies, there is an unevenneſſe of the heart as was in <hi>Saul,</hi> who ſpared the choiſeſt, and mortified the courſeſt of the cattle, or as in <hi>Balaam,</hi> who would have been happy in his death, though a Curſer of Gods people (in reſpect of his own intention) in this life.</p>
                        <p>I Confeſſe this to be true, that uprightneſſe is not the utter Annihilation of ſin, No, that effect appertaines to glory, and perfection above; but it is the even and Impartiall oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſin: of ſecret ſins, and of preſumptious ſins, (as <hi>David</hi>

here in this <hi>Pſalm)</hi> of great and ſmall; in a word it is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctive oppoſition of ſin, that is it carries the heart againſt all ſin, Pſal. 119. 1. <hi>Bleſſed are the undefiled in the way,</hi> v. 3. <hi>They do no iniquity (i)</hi> their hearts are for no ſin: and the prime rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of all this oppoſition, I ſay the prime and immediate reaſon, is direct and not <hi>reflexive;</hi> It is becauſe ſin is ſo oppoſite to God and not primarily, becauſe it its ſo painfull in the event to the perſon.</p>
                        <p>3. <hi>For duties:</hi> here uprightneſſe expreſſeth it ſelfe, both <hi>for matter,</hi> wherein, it doth not ſhuffle and cut, pick and chuſe, <note place="margin">For duties.</note> take the lighter (like the hypocriticall Phariſees) and leave the heavieſt to others, but it makes a man to have (with <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 119. 6.) <hi>a reſpect to all Gods commands.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>For the manner,</hi> Any performance will not ſerve, where the heart is upright, <hi>David danceth before the Lord withal his might; and Paul ſerveth God in his ſpirit,</hi> That which came next to hand will <hi>ſerve Cain,</hi> but <hi>Abel</hi> muſt preſent the <hi>beſt of the Cattle,</hi> not the lame and the blind, the beſt, God, ſhall have the beſt man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of ſervice, If I heare, that ſufficeth not, unleſſe it be with reverence and faith; If, I pray, that ſufficeth not, unleſſe with brokenneſs of heart, humbleneſſe of ſpirit, fervent affections, and faith in Chriſt: A meer tale of bricke will ſerve for <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> though the Iſralites reputed the ſervice a bondage, but when we bring offerings to the Temple, they muſt be willing, and of the beſt too.</p>
                        <p>6. The laſt thing which I would obſerve in uprightneſſe is <hi>its end and ſcope.</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Its end and ſcope.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>Beloved I pray you to remember that uprightneſſe cauſeth a threefold reference of our ſervices: one is to <hi>Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept:</hi> that's the ſquare and Rule and compaſſe of upright motions.</p>
                        <p>Another is to <hi>Gods glory,</hi> that's the ſpring which turnes the wheels, the winde which blowes the ſayles: it is for <hi>Chriſt ſake,</hi> ſaid Paul: and <hi>whatſever yee do, do all to the glory of God,</hi> ſaid he againe.</p>
                        <p>A third is to <hi>Gods acceptance and approbation,</hi> ſo that God will accept, and commend, and approve, 2. Cor. 5. 9. <hi>we labour that whither preſent or abſent, we may be accepted of him,</hi> 2. Cor.
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:115641:100"/>
10. 18. <hi>Not he that commendeth himſelfe is approved, but whom the Lord commendeth.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>More plaine and punctual is that of the ſame Apoſtle, in Rom. 2. 29. <hi>He is a few which is one inwardly, and circumciſion is that of the heart in the ſpirit, and not in the letter, whoſe praiſe is not of men but of God.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The ſchoolmens obſervation is ſound and true that a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar deficiency is ſufficient to marre a good, morally conſidered, but an vniverſall concurrence of circumſtances, is required to make the action good. Look, as in reading of Hebrew, leave out but one tittle, one point, you mar the ſenſe, or as in a doſis of Phyſick, leave out one ingredient you ſpoyle all. Soe our actions if one circumſtance be left out, if the Right and genuine end, be not eyed, it is enough to blanch them with hypocriſie, though for ſubſtance they may be commanded to pray, and to give alms, no man will queſtion that theſe duties ſubſtantially conſidered, are good, and ſuch which the upright perſon doth performe. But then if a man prayes, or gives almes to be ſeen of men, Chriſt tells him that he playes the Hypocrite; If in the performance of any piouſly externall duty we ſet our ſelves as the end, if all theſe things be done, and with very much fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vency and Aſſiduity, yet only to play the Merchants for our ſelves, to make a bridge over to our own eſtimation to blow up our names; This is but Hypocriſie, and I fear a kind of Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, we fall down and worſhip our ſelves, like the men of <hi>She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chem</hi> who would admit of circumciſion, <hi>ſhall not their cattle, and all that they have be ours;</hi> The like indifferentneſſe may be found in men forward for outward duties, ſhall not profit be ours, preachers good opinion ours, The Glory and Credite ours, this is a groſs Hypocriſie?</p>
                        <p>Now uprightneſſe conſiſts in this, to devolve all the honor of holy ſervices on God, like the faithfull ſervant, who workes painefully, and ſpeakes conſideratly and all this for his Maſter; or like the ſhadow which in the dyall moves from point to point, and all this points upward to the ſunne in it motions; The humble heart knowes no fountaine but Gods grace. and the upright heart knowes no end, but Gods glory.</p>
                        <p>They diſtinguiſh of a double end.</p>

And when this is done, then to ſet up the right end and ſcope, and their to ſettle our intention faſt and plaine: O how difficult! many by aimes and indirect ends do often preſent themſelves, that it is with us, as with boys in writing, we draw many crooked lines, or as with them in archery, we ſhoot by hither or beyond, or beſide the mark; it is not eaſie to do good becauſe God commands it, or only becauſe he may be glorifled.</p>

                        <p>1. If a man be upright, <hi>he will moſtly ſtrive for an inward re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of his heart.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>There are two things which the upright perſon doth moſt look <note place="margin">The upright man moſt ſtrives for the inward reformation.</note> at, his God, and his heart. The Hypocrites (as our ſaviour teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies) they are for the outſide, they waſh the platters and the cups, and beautifie the tombes, like an adultereſſe whoſe care is to paint, and to ſet a faire face upon the matter; all their care is to the eye of man: how to be ſeen and hard, how to be well thought on? Now uprightneſſe is moſtly for the heart and ſpirit: not that an upright perſon ſhould or doth neglect the wel-ordering his life, O no! as to neglect our hearts, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues hypocriſie; ſo to neglect our lives argues profaneſſe.</p>
                        <p>But the principle care of uprightneſſe is the reformation of the heart; though it lookes to the cleanſing of the hand, yet principally of the heart, according to that of the Apoſtle, <hi>Jam.</hi> 4. 8.

If this heart were humble! If this heart were heavenly! If the heart were believing! The hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite cares not though the thread be rotten, if the colour or gloſſe be faire: but the upright perſon he is more at ſubſtance then ſhew, and hath more to doe with his heart, then any thing: he would have the law written not upon his tongue, but upon his heart cleanſed, as well as his life beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.</p>

                        <p>There is a difference twixt deſires of holineſs, for it ſelfe and God, and for our ſelves and ends: An hypocrite could be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to have as much holineſſe, as would ſerve his turne, his owne turne, his owne ends; as a tradeſmen is willing to be at coſt that his apprentice learne to writ and cipher, ſo much, and ſo long, as he may be enabled to keep the accounts; but he will not be at coſt to teach him the excellency of writing or ciphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring. But now the upright perſon deſires grace, and holineſs for God; that glory may be brought unto him, and out of an intrinſecall love of the beauties of holineſſe, and for the farther rooting out of ſin, And for the better Inabling to holy ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices: his ends are publike and therefore a little ſerves not.</p>

But now he is not equally delighted, this acceptance of the word is not univerſal: let the ſame word be delivered as a ſearching, and dividing, and condemning word, then it is otherwiſe. Now you ſhall ſee, that the ſhaking of the tree will make the rotten fruit at the core (which yet looked red and ripe to the eye) to fall to the ground: let the word come cloſe, and lay hold, and ſearch him to the quick; Now you ſhall ſee the hypocrite like the wounded or crazy part, though cloathed as fair as the ſound parts, yet if ſtrictly handled, the party cannot endure, he cannot abide it, he grows impatient and unquiet.

The hypocrite may (in a kinde of preternatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral heat) he may in a fit, in a preſent heat fall violently upon duty, upon reſolution; O what a man will he become, how ſhall his family be reformed; and now he will read, and hear, and pray, and he will leave his ſinne; but anon he hath loſt

                        <p>There are three times wherein an hypocrite may expreſſe great forwardneſſe in duties, in ſervices to God.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>2. Another, when obedience and duty are not dangerous, but calme and commodious: As the <hi>Samaritans,</hi> when the <hi>Jews</hi> proſpered, &amp;c. Therefore Chriſt ſets out an <hi>Hypocrite</hi> by that <hi>ground which was ſtony, and had not much earth, upon which the ſeed fell, and forthwith ſprang up</hi> (without any more ado) <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. 5. <hi>but when the Sunne was up, it was ſcorched and withered away,</hi> ver. 6.

And <hi>yet this endureth but for a while, for when tribulation, or perſecution ariſeth becauſe of the Word, by and by he is offended,</hi> ver. 21. If Gods ſervice be ſo hot, ſo dangerous, if it muſt coſt him his liberty, his eſtate, his friends, his eaſe, his life, then farwel it: <hi>The houſe built on the ſands, when the wind a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſe, it fell,</hi> Mat. 7. 27.</p>
                        <p>3. When he hath ſome props, or in the preſence of others. Many do duties while <hi>Moſes</hi> is preſent, or <hi>Jehoiadah</hi> lives, or the <hi>good judges</hi> continue; but if <hi>Moſes</hi> be abſent, then the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> turn <hi>Idolaters,</hi> and if <hi>Jehoiadah</hi> dies, then <hi>Joaſh</hi> is naught, and if the <hi>Judges</hi> die, then the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> do <hi>what is right in their own eyes.</hi>

But the upright perſon is ſimple in his obedience; a naked command is reaſon enough for him to obey, and Gods glory is a ſufficient motive: If a ſervant be faithful in his factoridge: why? it is enough to him in the managing of buſineſſe, if he can ſet forward his maſters ſtock, his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity is all that he looks on: And thus is uprightneſſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcried

                        <p>There are two things which may befal a man upon the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of any holy duties.</p>
                        <p>One is <hi>rejoycing,</hi> and this is lawful, when God hath enlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged my heart in prayer; when he hath quickned me in his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, raiſed my affections, animated my faith, aſſiſted me more then ordinary againſt my dulneſſe, diſtractions, unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, temptations, I may rejoyce, my heart ſhould be raiſed to bleſſe the Lord, and (in ſome caſes to ſpeak) of this his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to his glory.</p>

But you may reply, if uprightneſſe may be truly diſcovered by the bent of the heart, then the vileſt perſon may be up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, for they confidently affirm that they meane no hurt, their deſires are good, they would know more, they would believe and repent, and leave their ſins, yea, they do ſtrive to enter in at the ſtrait gate.</p>
                        <p>To this I anſwer.</p>
                        <p>Firſt, if any man who hath been wicked, doth now finde the purpoſe and bent of his heart ſet for God, that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires of his ſoul are unfeignedly to pleaſe God, I ſhould not doubt but God had changed this man, and his heart were now made upright.</p>
                        <p>But ſecondly, I conjecture that no wicked man doth, or can have this bent and purpoſe of heart to pleaſe God, to obey God in all things; for it imports theſe things;</p>

                        <p>2. An habitual inclination, not a pang of the ſoul, not a mood, not a fit of an ague, not a flaſh of lightning, not as the morning dew: But <hi>my ſoule breaketh for the longing that it hath unto thy judgements at all times,</hi> Pſalm 119. 20.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, an active purpoſe; <hi>Herein I do exerciſe or endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour my ſelf</hi> (ſaid <hi>Paul)</hi> Acts 24. 16. though the purpoſe in an upright man doth exceed his actions, yet there is ſome active and working ability with his purpoſe, he will be doing ſervice to all, to God. It is with evil men in their purpoſes, as with <hi>Pilate,</hi> he was purpoſed to let Chriſt go, but yet he gave ſentence: ſo they pretend a purpoſe to pleaſe God, but ſtill live in their ſinnes, and do not ſtirre up them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves at all, to all the means by which they may get grace and ſtrength.</p>

                        <p>A Second Uſe of this point ſhall be for <hi>comfort to ſuch as are upright:</hi> There are many ſweet comforts which may greatly revive and chear up ſuch as are upright; I will touch <note place="margin">For comfort to ſuch as are up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right.</note> ſome of them at this time.</p>
                        <p>1. One comfort is this, that there is a gracious <hi>acceptance of their weak ſervices:</hi> The King of <hi>Perſia</hi> did lovingly accept the poor mans handful of water, and put it into a golden veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, <note place="margin">There is a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of their weake ſervices.</note> and gave him that veſſel of gold. To ſet this on, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider,</p>
                        <p>Firſt, that all our holy ſervices, <hi>they are the tithes</hi> (as it were) <hi>of our graces,</hi> the rents of our helps, a certain homage, which we bring in to God: they are ſuch expreſſions or acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons by which we ſtrive to bring God glory, and to pleaſe him.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, that the <hi>beſt ſervices are imperfect:</hi> as no man doth ſo much as he ſhould, ſo the beſt Chriſtian doth not ſo well as he ſhould: Look, as the higheſt grace is ſtill in defect, ſo the moſt ſolemn duties are ſtill in default. It is with the beſt man in duty, as with the Moon, though it be at the full, and ſhineth moſt clearly, yet even then it hath its ſpots; ſo when the heart is moſt enlarged with intentions and heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affections, there is yet ſome contrary twange, or ſome ſhortneſſe, ſome blemiſhableneſſe notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>

                           <pb n="219" facs="tcp:115641:116"/>
Therefore <hi>Aaron</hi> was not only to bear the iniquities of the people, but he was alſo to bear the iniquity of the <hi>holy offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,</hi> Exod. 28. 38.</p>
                        <p>For as it was with <hi>Jacob</hi> after his earneſt ſtrugling with the <hi>Angel,</hi> he aroſe with a lame and halting thigh, ſo is it with all of us, both in and after our moſt affectionate per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances, we are weak in our feet: that is not good which is done by a good man; and though he doth much which God doth reward, yet he doth nothing ſo compleatly, but God needs in ſomething or other of it to pardon and cover. Not only our ſinnes can accuſe us, but ſome ſinfulneſſe in our beſt actions: no man prays, or heares, or reades, or acts any ſervice of piety or charity, in that full and ample emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency or integrity of degrees, but that he may with the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders in the <hi>Revelations,</hi> caſt theſe Crowns down to the ground.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, that by reaſon <hi>of theſe imperfections in duties, there is more reaſon</hi> (in a ſtrict way of Juſtice) <hi>that God ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject all, then that he ſhould accept of any thing.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Beloved, it is granted, that God doth not reject the ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of his ſervants; nay, as he doth requite them, ſo he will accept of them, and reward them; but this is not for the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the ſervant, but from the graciouſneſſe of the Maſter. For if God ſhould anſwer any imperfect ſervice (yea, that which hath but a very little, and particular imperfection, ſuppoſe them to be ſome contrary tranſient thoughts, or ſome thinner indiſpoſitions hanging about us in our du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties) I ſay if God ſhould anſwer them from the court of pure Juſtice, you ſhould finde that the mixture of a little ſin would eaſily cry down the acceptance of much good: The moſt good which I bring in my ſervices it is but duty, and the leaſt evil which I bring is beſides the duty, and the evil in du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, be not able to make that part which is good to be bad, yet it is able to ſhut out the ſervice from acceptance, becauſe, by reaſon of that evil, the ſervice is not ſo good as God may and doth require, if he ſhould ſtand with us upon tearms of ſtrict Juſtice.</p>
                        <p>But then fourthly; <hi>though there be many imperfections clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving</hi>
                           <pb n="220" facs="tcp:115641:117"/>
                           <hi>to the ſervices of men, yet if they be upright, God will</hi> (for all them) <hi>graciouſly accept of their ſervices.</hi> Though I pray (and with many diſtractions) and though I heare (and within my interpretations) yet if I be upright in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances of theſe <hi>(i.)</hi> if my heart be for God (indeed) un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der theſe that I bring in the truth, and preſent ſtrength of my ſpirit, with all humble reſpect to Gods commands, and unfeigned integrity of aiming at Gods glory, the ſervices are graciouſly accepted with God.</p>
                        <p>Yea, though I cannot alwayes uſe ſo many words in prayer, though expreſſions are not ſo many at this time as at another; nay, though I finde not that livelihood and chearfulneſs now as heretofore, yet if the heart be upright, the ſervice is done and accepted. There are two things which may aſſure a good man that his ſervices are accepted.</p>
                        <p>One is <hi>faith,</hi> when he preſents his ſervices in the name of Chriſt: look, as every ſinner needs a Mediatour of redemption, ſo every good man ſtill needs the ſame Chriſt as a Mediatour of interceſſion for his ſervices: And though ſervices (as done by us) can finde no favour, yet as preſented by Chriſt, they are alwayes a ſweet ſavour before the Lord, he is that <hi>Angel,</hi> who hath a <hi>golden Cenſer, and hath much incenſe, which he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers with the prayers of all Saints before the Throne,</hi> Rev. 8. 3. though our ſervices be but weak teſtimonies, yet Chriſts inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion is a ſtrong and mighty ingratiating both of our perſons and actions.</p>
                        <p>Another is <hi>uprightneſſe;</hi> when the heart is true and plain in what it doth: Beloved, remember this, that as God doth not reſpect the ſtrongeſt parts, which are paſſiue, as I may ſay, and are idle, ſo he doth not reject the meaneſt abilities, if up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightly imployed. No, not the day of ſmall things is deſpiſed by him; if the flax be ſmoaking, though it flame not, he will not quench it, that is, he will not only, not ſlight it, but cheriſh and accept of it, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 12. The widows mite, the cup of cold water was accepted.</p>
                        <p>If a man can truly ſay, Lord, I would believe more ſtedfaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly if I could, and I ſtrive to believe, and I would pray bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, if I could, yet as well as I can, I now preſent my ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:115641:117"/>
before thee, I would ſerve thee more fully, more intirely, that is the deſire of my ſoul, and my endeavour, if I had wherewithal, thou ſhouldſt have a better heart, more lively affections, more ample and chearful duties, all ſhould be better, if I had a better power: I ſay that notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the many imperfections, yet this uprightneſſe, this holy frame of a compleat and active will (wherein all the powers of the ſoul are bent to ſervices according to the preſent power of the meaſure of grace <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">
                              <desc>•••</desc>

I pray you remember that of <hi>David, like as a father pities his childe, ſo the Lord pitieth them that feare him,</hi> Pſal. 103. 13. And that of the Prophet, <hi>I will ſpare them as a man ſpareth his own ſonne that ſerveth him,</hi> Mal. 3. 17. The father commands his childe to lift up the weight, and the childe readily addreſſeth to the obedience, he lifts, and aſſayes, and ſtill he gives another ha at it, but perhaps he cannot get it quite up; why? the father likes his childe for this, and though perhaps the weight be where it was, yet he calls this act of his child true obedience, why? becauſe, though that be not done which the father impoſed, yet it had been done if the child had more ſtrength, and he endeavoured with all his ſtrength for to do it. Or thus, the father wills the childe to ſhoot an Arrow, the child draws the Arrow, perhaps but half way, and though his eye were upon the mark, yet his arrow falls ſhort many Bowes length; why? the father will yet commend all this, for though he ſees that the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row is ſhort, yet he obſerves that the Bowe was drawn, and although the mark be not hit with the Arrow, yet it was aim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at with the eye of the childe: ſo is it with God our father, who commands ſuch and ſuch duties, to which, if we addreſſe our ſelves with uprightneſs, he will wink and paſſe by the weakneſs in action, whiles he both obſerves and accepts the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity of intention and affection.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Obj.</hi> O ſaith an upright perſon, I finde ſuch infinite heaps of other thoughts, ſuch dulneſſe and deadneſſe of ſpirit, ſuch untowardlineſſe, ſo many weakneſſes every way, all which are the grief of my ſoul, and it troubles me much, that I

cannot do the good that I would) how will the Lord take ſuch broken ſervices from me.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Sol.</hi> I anſwer if thy heart be upright in theſe interrupted ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices, God hath mercy to pardon the weakneſſes, and he hath wiſdome to finde out the uprightneſſe, and he hath graciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to accept of the dutifulneſſe.</p>
                        <p>A Goldſmith will not caſt away thoſe leſſer raies of gold, though mingled, and (to an inexpert perſon) confounded with various heaps of droſſe and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                           </gap>ſt: now, he hath an art to find out the little gold, and put ſide the droſſe. Though with all our holy actions there be much corruption and weakneſs commixt, yet there is ſuch a wiſe art in Gods gracious mercy, as to finde out uprightneſſe, and holineſſe of deſire and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour in a ſervice commanded with many infirmities, 2 <hi>Chr.</hi> 30, 18. the <hi>Lord pardon every one,</hi> v. 19. <hi>That prepareth his heart to ſeek the Lord God of his fathers, though he be not cleanſed according to the purification of the Sanctuary,</hi> verſe 20. <hi>And the Lord hearkened to</hi> Hezekiah, <hi>and healed the people.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>2. A ſecond comfort is this, that <hi>if a man be upright, he ſhall not only finde acceptance for ſervices, but alſo indulgence for of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences.</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">If a man be up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right he ſhall not only finde acceptance for ſervice but indulgence for offence.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>You muſt ever diſtinguiſh twixt the cauſe and the ſubject; the cauſe of all pardoning indulgence, is the free grace of God in the blood of Chriſt, but the ſubject of indulgence, is the perſon to whom God is pleaſed to give his pardon and releaſe.</p>
                        <p>None comes in under the wings of the mercy-ſeat ſo as the upright perſons: Uprightneſſe in Scripture hath (in a well underſtood ſenſe) ſeemed to cover all: you read of King <hi>Aſa,</hi> and of many paſſages which did greatly blur him both as a King, and as a good man, he did not break down the high-places, he ſought to the Phyſicians, he joyned to the King of <hi>Syria,</hi> he caſt the Prophet into priſon, who reproved him for it, yet (2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 15. 17.) <hi>the heart of Aſa</hi> is ſaid to be <hi>perfect all his dayes:</hi> How? all his dayes: and yet ſuch ſinnings ſometimes; yes, all his dayes, for ſinnes ſtand upon the account, and ſeeme to be reckoned, not ſo much
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:115641:118"/>
when they are done, as when they are done with a ſinful heart.</p>
                        <p>And they loſe upon the account, they are ſtruck off, God paſſeth over them, when the bent of their heart is againſt them: ſee that place and paſſage of <hi>David, Bleſſed is he whoſe tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion is forgiven, and whoſe ſin is covered,</hi> ver. 2. <hi>Bleſſed is the man to whom the Lord imputeth no iniquity:</hi> verily brethren, that mans eſtate is bleſſed, whoſe ſins are pardoned; O! if the Lord be reconciled to a man, if the Lord covers his ſinne, <hi>(i.)</hi> will not look upon them in a judicial way, ſo as to account and reckon with the ſinner for them; if the Lord will not impute iniquity to him <hi>(i.)</hi> though he hath iniquity, yet the Lord will forgive it, it ſhall not redound unto him in puniſhment: but it ſhall be blotted out, and be as if it had never been: tell me ſeriouſly, is not this a bleſſed thing; tell me now you whoſe hearts are ready to break aſunder with the ſenſe of guilt, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther pardoning mercy be not a moſt bleſſed and deſirable thing. You will freely confeſſe it is, but then the queſtion is, who is that man that is ſo bleſſed, what is his temper how is he qualified.</p>
                        <p>See on (in that <hi>ver.</hi> 2.) <hi>he is one in whoſe ſpirit is no guile,</hi> what's that? that is, he is the upright perſon, whoſe ſpirit is really and plainly for God, who in truth deſires to pleaſe him, who in truth hates all ſin. This is that bleſſed man, and in this is a great part of his bleſſedneſſe, that the Lord will not impute his iniquities unto him, but will forgive and cover them <hi>(i.)</hi> ſo forgive them that they ſhall not riſe upon the account any more: <hi>Paul</hi> did upon this conclude by way of teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony to himſelf, and for others, that there was <hi>no condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on unto them,</hi> Rom. 8. 1. why? what was <hi>Paul?</hi> what was his temper? verily it was upright.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Obj.</hi> Upright, why? he complains of ſin, that he was ſold under it, he complaines of the <hi>Law of his members warring against the Law of his mind,</hi> he complains that <hi>he was brought into captivity;</hi> he complaines that when he <hi>would do good, yet evill was preſent with him.</hi> How then can be ſay, that there was no condemnation for him? how was he upright?</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="224" facs="tcp:115641:119"/>
                           <hi>Sol.</hi> Thus, his being upright did not conſiſt in this, that he had no ſin in him; nor in this, that he did no ſin; nor in this, that he did all the good which he ſaw ſhould be done: But in this, that he hated the ſin which dwelt in him, that he reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the evil working in him; that his inward man approved the good, and condemned the evil; that his inward man hated the evil, and was delighted in the Law of God. This was his uprightneſs, and upon this he concludes, that there was no condemnation, <hi>(i.)</hi> his ſinne ſhould not ſink his ſoul to hell, they ſhould not ſeparate him from the love of God in Chriſt, they ſhould not be imputed to him, but Chriſt would take them off. <note place="margin">An upright perſon the Lord is his God in cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>3. A third comfort to an upright perſon is this, that the <hi>Lord is his God in Covenant.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>You are not Ignorant of the Covenant which God did ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulate with <hi>Abraham, Gen.</hi> 17. 1. <hi>I am the Almighty</hi> (al-ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient) <hi>walk before me and be thou perfect,</hi> what is the meaning of that? In a Covenant you know there are two par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and they mutually undertake and agree: ſo, here<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is God on the one part, and here is <hi>Abraham</hi> on the other part, and God promiſeth, and <hi>Abraham</hi> promiſeth; God promiſeth to be All-ſufficient unto him, and engageth himſelf in an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Covenant to be his God, <hi>ver.</hi> 7. now <hi>Abraham</hi> promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth to walk uprightly before the Lord: and this is all that the Lord agrees with him for <hi>(walke before me and be up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right)</hi> and then I am thy God, and I will be thy All-ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Obj.</hi> Why? you will ſay, this is granted, it is cleare, that God Covenants to be a God to an upright perſon, But what, ſo great comfort in that?</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Sol.</hi> Nay then, I have done, if yet you underſtand not, If yet you think it ſo poore, ſo meane a thing for God to be your God in Covenant. I tell you brethren, when God becomes your God in Covenant, when he ſaith to a perſon, I will be a God unto thee; it is infinitely more then if the Lord ſhould ſay to a man, I will give unto the all the world: O for God to be my God, what is it but this, I am thine, and all that I am, or have, or can do ſhall be thine and for thee. I am an
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:115641:119"/>
holy God and that ſhall be to make thee holy, I am a merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full God and that ſhall be to pardon thy ſins, I am a powerfull God and that ſhal be to help thee, to deliver thee, to conquer for thee; I am a faithfull God and that ſhall be to make every pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe good which I have made unto thee, I am a wiſe God, and that ſhall be to bring in thy comforts, thy deliverances, thy helps in the moſt deſirable ſeaſon.</p>
                        <p>When ſins trouble thee I will pardon them; when they are too ſtrong for thee, I will ſubdue them; when thy heart is ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, I will comfort it; when thy graces are weak, I will ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en them; when men diſgrace thee I will honour thee, when dangers ariſe I will preſerve thee, what thou needeſt, that I will give thee; what thou haſt, that I will bleſſe to thee; all this, and far more then this, it is for God to be our God in covenant! Nay, and all this is ours by covenant, that is? it is not a faire and emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty pretext, it is not a glorious and vaine complement, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſo, and firmly ſo; the Lord if he be our God in covenant; doth bind himſelfe to be all this unto us, by the fidelity of his nature, by the truth of all his promiſes, by the ſeale of the blood of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</p>

In paſſions and temptations we neither ſee God aright nor our ſelves.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, we muſt <hi>never ſtand to that judgement which we paſs upon our inward frame, which is Irrational or without ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient ground?</hi> Look as we may appeale from all the ſentence of our judgement, which acts its ſelfe in time of paſſion, as he did from <hi>Alexander</hi> to, <hi>Alexander,</hi> &amp;c. ſo neither muſt we vainely vex our hearts, and daſh out our uprightneſſe, when <note place="margin">Simile.</note> this ſentence is rather of imagination then of reaſon: when a man thinkes, and thinkes that he is not upright, though all the evidences of uprightneſſe appeare in him, and when he cannot produca any one inherently diſtinguiſhing ground of an hypocrite in himſelfe; why? this is but an imaginary judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and utterly unreaſonable, this is to condemne the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent without cauſe.</p>
                        <p>That ſoule will never be ſettled with comfort which gives way to its one imaginations: and hath a conceit, that every ſinfull thought, or violent temptation, or more durable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict with an inward corruption, or frequent diſtractions in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly duties, cannot ſtand with uprightneſſe: where a man hath either no grounds at all, or thoſe that he hath are falſe, he ſhould never ſettle ſo on them, and yield and entertaine them, as to queſtion his eſtate for them, or for them to ſhut off himſelfe from comfort.</p>
                        <p>5. If ever we would decide our uprightneſſe, and ſo take our parts in promiſed comforts, <hi>we muſt follow the voyce of the word, and ſubſcribe to the ſentence of conſcience following that word.</hi>

                        <p>Be ſure of this, that if the word will allow and warrant thy inward frame; If it approves of it as ſound, aſſuredly it is ſo; for that Rule cannot erre, nor is divine judgement (which is contained in the word) capable of falſehold or deceit, active<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly or paſſively: If God ſaith thy heart is right with him, main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine it againſt all diſputes whatſoever.</p>
                        <p>Yea, and if thy conſcience inlightned, rectified and quickned by the word, doth acquit thee for upright, that now ſtanding before the preſence of the eternal God and all knowing judge, it can ſay thus much for thee, that though heretofore thou

                        <p>But may ſome troubled and miſ-giving heart reply, nay, it <note place="margin">Diverſe caſes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</note> is not thus and thus with us; ſure we are, that we are not up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, and the grounds which make us thus to conclude, are not imaginary, but real; true it is we do labour to abſtaine from <note place="margin">1.

                        <p>3.

Like an unwilling ſlave, who would break away, or would not put forth himſelf in acts of ſervice, were it not the mere feare of the laſh <note place="margin">Simile.</note> of the whip did force and awe him.</p>
                        <p>Another is <hi>mixt</hi> and <hi>compounded:</hi> when though a man doth ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaine and act out of feare, yet not onely principally out of feare; but alſo out of love commixt with that feare: as a childe who though he doth forbeare many things out of a reſpect to his fathers power, and diſpleaſure, yet withall he doth ceaſe them out of a love to his fathers goodneſſe, and kinde affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; thus may it be with a perſon who is upright, he may for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare ſin, out of a feare of Gods power, and juſtice, and diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure: and yet withall out of a love to an holy and gracious God and a father, for both of theſe may have their work in him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <note place="margin">Simile.</note> a prejudice one to another, or either to the temper of uprightneſſe, Hoſea. 3. 5. <hi>they ſhall feare the Lord and his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</hi> The love of an upright man is ſo pitched on Gods good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, that withall it gives way to feare, to apprehend his greatneſſe, and yet the feare of his God is not ſo awed by great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, but withall love may come in to inflame the ſoule to make it either abſtaine, or act out of a reſpect to Gods goodneſs. Therefore <hi>Paul,</hi> though he did perſwade men becauſe he knew the terror of the Lord, yet was alſo exceedingly induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, becauſe the <hi>love of Chriſt did conſtraine him,</hi> 2.

                        <p>Now I ſaid, if a man doth abſtaine from ſinne, or act duty, meerly out of a ſervile feare, he is not upright, why? be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in uprightneſſe, the heart is carried againſt ſin, and the will is inclined to duty, both which are wanting, where feare is only ſervile. <note place="margin">Fillial.</note>

                        <p>Another when we drive on the ſin with a cuſtomary trade and continuances.

                        <p>Now the caſe is, whither a man may be reputed upright who many times finds himſelfe thus in his ſervices.</p>

                           <hi>Sol.</hi> I ſhall briefly aſſoyle this Inquiry.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. <hi>Selfe-applauſe is the magnifying of our ſelves for duties</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Self-applauſe what it is.</note> 
                           <hi>happily performed;</hi> It is a kind of adoration and admiration of our ſelves by higher opinions of our ſelves, or thoughts alſo, that no others will highly imagine of us, and admire the emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency of our parts, and gifts, and quick abilities, and enlarged affections.</p>
                        <p>Now this I ſay, that though a man may be lawfully enlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with joy and thankfulneſs to God, who hath graciouſly aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted and inlarged him in the performance of duties, and his ſpirit thereupon may be the more cleered. Yet ſelf-applauſe is naught, and oppoſite to uprightneſs; it is nothing elſe but a forgetfulneſs of our God, and of his ſtrength, &amp; of his grace, by which we did his ſervice; It doth not ſpring from humble up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightneſs. but from a proud conceitedneſs; and is the After-clap of Satan, and our ſinfull hearts, which kick down, and undo that work which otherwiſe had been very well done.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Again, <hi>Vain glory is the ſetting forth of our ſelves in duty,</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Vain glory what it is.</note> it is the uſing of our Maſters coin for the ſervants benefit: When a man doth hear, or preach, or pray, or give alms, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly or principally to be ſeen, to be eſteemed, to be ſpoken of, his own credit is the end of his work. This is a manifeſt fruit of Hypocriſie, Chriſt hath delivered it fully in <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. Look as he playes the Hypocrite, who doth ſome good, but yet will will not do all duty, and who doth much duty, but loves ſome ſin; ſo likewiſe he playes the Hypocrite, that doth all duty, meerly to advance and trumpet out his own name, and eſtimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and glory. Self-applauſe is a ſubſequent Hypocriſie which follows the work; <hi>Vain-glory</hi> is an Antecedent Hypocriſie <note place="margin">Diſtinguiſh of ſelf-applauſe and vain glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</note> which moves us to the work.</p>

<pb n="248" facs="tcp:115641:131"/>
or in, or after Duties. In the other they riſe up as natural affections; the one feeds on them as on meat; the other is troubled with them as with poyſon: they break the heart of the one with pride, of the other, with ſorrow and humbling: In the one, they are approbations; in the the other, they are vexations: In an Hypocrite they are like the wind which fills the ſails; In an upright perſon they are like the wind which troubles the ſtomack. The Duties done by an Hypocrite, are like glaſſes made and blown up, only by breath: the Applauſe of men breaths ſtrongly upon his affections to ſet out his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices. But it is with an uptight perſon in this caſe, as with a leaf on a tree, a little breathing of the air makes it to tremble: An upright perſon is afraid of his own high opinion, or the commendation of others; He can be highly glad when the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour is caſt on God; and if any after-riſings begin to grow for former Duties, he is not well, till he hath caſt them down, by after-humblings. The upright perſon is much with God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore duty, and all for God after it: He takes all the ſtrength of Action out of Gods hand, and therefore would not finger the leaſt ſcruple of praiſe: He looks on inward applauſe as a croſs, and on publique as a danger: In the one I hate my ſelf, in the other I fear my ſelf.</p>

                        <p>No more to this caſe, but this, beg for much grace to do duty, and when you have done it, beg for much ſtrength to give God the glory of it: An Hypocrite is made up of himſelf and men; but the upright perſon is made only by God, and for him.</p>

Ah, vain man! to think there is not a day for the diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of ſecrets, or that there is not a God who ſearcheth the hearts and reins, who greedily hunts after the applauſe and credit of men, and declines the approbation of the great Judge. O when thy accounts are to be preſented and given up before the tribunal ſeat of the holy, and true, and terrible God; and thou ſhalt then ſay, O Lord, all the outward good I did, I did it only to get my ſelf a name; all the ſervices of Religion, I laboured in them only that men might think well of me: ſome of thy precepts I did like, but others I did not care for, becauſe they thwarted my ends; much good I did, but it was only to cloak and cover the much ſecret evil which I did love, and in which I did walk: ſo many years I lived, and kept company with Chriſtians, againſt whoſe pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfull practiſe of holineſs my heart did riſe; many a time did their heavenly diſcourſes find out and condemn my private luſt, yet I bleared their eyes, I yet wreſted with my conſcience, I would not yet leave all my ſins, and now wo is me! thou doſt love truth in the inward parts, this I knew, yet I played the hypocrite. Nay, if more may be added, then take this, the Lord God after death will ſhut the door againſt ſuch fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh perſons who content themſelves with lamps without oyl, and do cry, Lord, Lord, have we not preached, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and heard thee in our ſtreets, and yet were workers of iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.

                        <p>1. If ever you would have <hi>upright hearts, you muſt then go to God for them.</hi> Hypocriſy is a natural weed, we need not go beyond our ſelves to find a cauſe of it: even a Child is able to frame actions to the eye of others: but uprightneſs is a flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of heaven: only that God who can make new, is able to make the heart upright. I pray you to conſider that all the holy qualities and tempets of the new Covenant, come from no other ſpring then Gods grace; none can beſtow them but God, and he can do it. Now the upright heart is a ſpring of the Covenant, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 39. <hi>I will give them one heart, and one way, that they may fear me for ever.</hi> Is there here a perſon this day who is ſenſible of the guile of his ſpirit, of the hypocriſie in his heart, that he cannot be ſo for God as he ſhould, that he is uneven, and oft-times crooked in his walkings? why? go to God! pray with <hi>David,</hi> Pſalm 51. 1. <hi>O create in me a clean heart, O Lord, and renew a right ſpirit within me.</hi>

                        <p>But you will ſay, may an hypocrite come to God, will God regard him though he calls upon him, will he not ſhut out his prayers; will he heare the prayer of him who regards ſin in his heart.</p>

I Anſwer.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Sol.</hi> It matters not how much hypocriſie hath been hatched within thee. and acted by thee heretofore, If now thou com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſt to be ſenſible of thy hypocriſie and to condemn it, &amp; to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wail it, &amp; to abhor it, if former hypocriſie be now come to hearty conflict, though be giving out into many thoughts of ſelfe and baſe ends, yet be not diſmayed, go to God, he can ſubdue it, and he can take out that guile of thy ſpirit, and he can faſhion a ſtraitneſſe and rightneſſe of heavenly frame within thee; he is able to make good whatſoever he hath promiſed.</p>
                        <p>Secondly if you would finde uprightneſſe in you, then <hi>get an</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Get a predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minat love of God and his wayes.</note> 
                           <hi>exceeding and predominate love of God, and his wayes:</hi> Love is of great force and influence to a mans ways and actions, it is like the Rudder which doth maſter the ſhip in the motion, it can turne and winde it any way; ſo doth love prevaile with the ſoule: it hath a command over it, about a mans ways and actions; if a man had a ſtrong love of God, if he did heartily, and with great affections, incline and ſtrive for God, for his glory, for his truth, this would prevaile with him to be upright, <hi>Deut.</hi> 10. 12. the love of God is put in as a meanes to walke in all his wayes, and to ſerve him with all our hearts.</p>
                        <p>The want of uprightneſſe, comes from the want of love; as the falſneſſe of a woman to her husband, growes upon want of conjugall love: it is the love of the world which draws a man ſo often aſide, which makes him off and on, and it is the love of ſin, which makes a man ſo hypocriticall.</p>
                        <p>If a man could love God above all, he would delight to walk with him, he would be careful to pleaſe him, fearful to offend him, ready to obey him, would be kept in for God, he would not make ſo many ſtrayings, he would minde Gods glory more.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly <hi>get to hate ſin,</hi> A ſecret love of ſin (after all reſtraints and pauſes) will draw the ſoule aſide, It will (like a covered <note place="margin">Get to hate ſin.</note> diſeaſe) break out againe.</p>
                        <p>There are three things in hatred which contribute to upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. It is an <hi>inward averſation:</hi> the very heart is drawen off from an object, and the heart is filled with a loathing and a deteſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:115641:133"/>
of the evill: not the tongue and looks onely, but the very inclination of the will is turned aſide.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. It is <hi>univerſall,</hi> for hatred is of the kinde: the will in the whole latitude of it, is the object of hatred, <hi>I hate every falſe way,</hi> ſaid <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 119.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. It is <hi>permanent</hi> and <hi>durable:</hi> paſſion is a ſtorme which will quickly off, but hatred is a ſetled quality, arguments al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay it not, nor doth time remove it: <hi>what have I to do any more with Idols,</hi> ſaid <hi>Ephraim,</hi> Hoſea. 14. 8. <hi>They ſhall defile their co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verings, and ſay unto them get thee hence,</hi> Eſa. 30. 22. So that if a man could get the hatred of ſin, he ſhould quickly finde an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven uprightneſſe.</p>
                        <p>The cauſe why a man is not even in his walking, is either becauſe,</p>
                        <p n="1">1. <hi>His heart is not bent againſt ſinne,</hi> but gives a delightful way unto it, it doth not reſiſt and loath it, but harbours and favours it.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. <hi>Some one particular luſt winnes and gaines upon the ſoule;</hi> though ſome are unacted, yet one ſpeciall luſt is retained which hath power to command and rule the life.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. <hi>He is carried againſt ſin upon mutable, and decaying grounds,</hi> which being removed, the heart then returnes to its proper and naturall bent.</p>
                        <p>But now if ſpiritual hatred of ſinne were implanted, then the combat twixt ſin, and the perſon would be inward, the very heart would loath the nature and inclinations of it, and it would be univerſall and conſtant, ſo that here would ariſe a generall evenneſſe in a mans coverſation. Unevenneſs though it appear without, yet it begins within the heart, is the maine wheele of a mans courſe, and therefore if love gets the heart for God, and hatred rules the heart againſt ſin, you may very well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that theſe two will yeeld out a very upright endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour and courſe of holineſſe. In ſpirituals, that which keeps the fountaine, doth keep the ſtreame, and that which betters the heart, doth likwiſe well order the life.</p>

                        <p>Sinning is the only departing from God, He never leaves us but for ſin, our departing is our unevenneſs, and we never leave him but by ſinne, and our unupright walkings; but that now which keeps us from departing, is feare? <hi>The feare of the Lord is a fountaine of life, to depart from the ſnares of death,</hi> Prov. 24. 27. If a man could alwayes keep an awful and powerfull regard to God: that he ſtood in awe of his attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes, and of his word, he would keep plaine with God, he would not tranſgreſſe for a morſel, nor thinke that it may be ſafe for him to ſin.</p>
                        <p>An Holy feare of God hath theſe two Properties.</p>
                        <p n="1">1.

But faith not only diſcovers falſe inducements, but alſo bringes better and ſtronger motives, it knowes and teacheth where the ſoule will be at a loſſe, and holds it off by the goodneſſe, and kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and loving favour of God: who would venture his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable aſpect of God, and ſweet communion with Chriſt, for a morſel of ſtollen bread, or for one draught of unlawful pleaſure?</p>
                        <p>2. <hi>It conſtraines the heart to ſingular love of God and Chriſt:</hi> the more faith the more love: all true faith is inflaming, for it ſees and feels much love, and therefore kindles much; now much love raiſeth much evenneſſe in walking, whiles the love is kept up cloſe to God, the heart and life ordinarily are kept in an upright motion: for all true love is tender and careful, and pleaſing.</p>
                        <p>3. <hi>It purifies the heart:</hi> Faith is like fire, which hath one qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to aſcend and another to burne: ſo faith it negotiates for us at heaven, and likewiſe it breeds more intrinſecall renovati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the heart by holineſſe: faith is the beſt friend to our gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, the ſureſt helpe to our affections, the ſtrongeſt prop to our duties, and the ſoreſt enemy to our ſinnes: No grace doth ſo much for the heart as faith, our aſſiſtance for good and our reſiſtance of evil depends moſt on it, we finde expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimentally, that many ſinnes then breake out when we looſe the ſight of God: as long as we can eye God, the ſoule is ſafe; ſee God in his promiſes, ſee God in his precepts, and ſee him in his Threatnings, and then we hold up and go on: but if once we loſe him in the ſight of his promiſes, then impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience and murmuring, and diſcontents, and unlawfull pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and wayes appeare in the heart and life, ſo alſo if we loſe him in the ſight of his precepts, which guide and binde, Now looſneſſe, and careleſneſſe, and indifferency appears: and loſe him in the ſight of his threatnings, now pride and preſumption and other bold adventurings appeare.

and fidelity and immutability of his promiſes for all kinde of good ſupplies and if we could ſee the power, and authority, and equity of all his precepts, reſpecting our actions and ways, and if one could behold the juſtice and terror of the Lord by faith in all his threatnings: O how might the ſoule be bounded and kept! like a river twixt its banks in a conſtant and ſweet courſe of even and upright walking.</p>
                        <p>3. If you would preſerve uprightneſſe, <hi>then you muſt get and</hi>

                        <p>There are three properties in humbleneſſe, which ſhew that <note place="margin">Simile.</note> it much conduceth to uprightneſſe.</p>
                        <p>One that <hi>it is much with God:</hi> hence we read of the cries of the humble, and the deſires of the heart; the humble ſoule is like the weake Ivie which clinges about the ſtrong oake, ſo it is much with a mighty God; you ſhall ſeldome finde the hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble perſon without a teare in his eye, a complaint in his tongue, a prayer in his heart, either you finde him upon his feet ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to hear what God will ſay, or upon his knee, craving what God will give.</p>

                              </gap>h much from God:</hi> There be high mountaines which be above all cloudes; the proud heart is moſt empty, becauſe moſt lofty, but <hi>God gives grace unto the humble,</hi> Jam. 4. the poor beggar gets the almes, and the low valley gets the ſhowers; and the humble heart the grace of God; and that both preventing grace which makes good an aſſiſting grace with holds on in good, <hi>thou haſt hard the deſire of the humble.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>3. A third, that it doth <hi>all for God:</hi> there are two things which the humble perſon doth moſt eye.</p>
                        <p>One is <hi>Gods rule,</hi> another is <hi>Gods glory,</hi> as a good ſervant who takes commandes from his maſters mouth, and layes out himſelfe for his maſters advantage: All is from him, and by him, and therefore all muſt be to him, ſaith the humble heart.</p>
                        <p>Now all theſe conduce directly to uprightneſſe, he is beſt in walking with God, who is moſt in calling up on God; pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:115641:135"/>
being like the firm and ſolid ground which enables the feet to ſtand beſt. And God is near to the humble: the weak child is preſerved from moſt falls, which is held by the hand of the mother, or carried in the boſom of the Nurſe: Where di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine ſtrength is moſt communicated, there the life is moſt uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formly ordered: and then humbleneſs refers all to Gods glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, it puts the cauſe of gift upon him, and the honor of their uſe, which is directly oppoſite to Hypocriſie; therefore labour to be humble, get to be ſenſible of your ſelves, both for natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals, and alſo ſpirituals; in the one, ſee your vileneſs; in the other, your emptineſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Fourthly, If you would get and preſerve uprightneſs, <hi>then</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Get your hearts to be crucified to the world.</note> 
                           <hi>get your hearts to be crucified to the world.</hi> Hypocriſie and worldlineſs are ſeldom far aſunder; It is rare to find an Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite, but he is one, who is either ſtrongly ambitious of honor, or greedily deſirous of Riches: ſearch the Scrriptures, and you ſhall find it ſo, and very cleerly in the <hi>Phariſees.</hi> Now when the heart is ſet upon the world, it is eaſily drawn aſide; it will ever &amp; anon be uneven: the bowl which hath a bias cannot run longe in a ſtrait line. <hi>They that will be rich fall into temptation and a ſnare, into many fooliſh &amp; hurtfull lusts,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>For the love of mony is the root of all evil,</hi> 2 Tim. 6. 9, 10. A thing of naught turns aſide the heart which is worldly: the look of a man, the hope of a nod, a change of garments, a morſel of bread, a meals meat, a few pieces of ſilver, all of theſe are to a worldly hearr, like the winde to the ſhip which turned the ſails round about. Therefore take heed of the world; moſt of our uneven carria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges ariſe from want of faith to exalt God, and from the enthral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our hearts to the world, we are under either the diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements of the world, and the fear of them make us to ſtep awry, or elſe the encouragements of it, and the hope, and love of them makes us to omit duties, or put out our hearts to wickedneſs. The ſear of man, and the too high account of carnal power, and too much love of our ſelves, and the world are ſore enemies to uprightneſs of heart or life; he who will know no Lord but Chriſt, and no ſafety like that of God, and no good like that which is heavenly, his ſpirit is ſound, and his life will be upright.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>Four conſiderations more.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. One, that <hi>God ſearcheth my heart, and ſtill looks upon my ways.

Nor can the ground, and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, and ends of our actions be ſecret to him who ſearcheth the heart and reins, and underſtands our thoughts a far off: we may blind the eyes of men, but we cannot delude the eye of God. The Lord ſeeth me in the dark, and my private courſes are as obvious to him, as the mountain to the ſun at noon-day; what way I take he well obſerves, and which way my heart runs, what it favours, and what it diſlikes; what I do, and what end I have in all my doings, and what principles and rules ſway within the chambers of my breaſt: This daily medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may be of force to look both to the matter of our doings, and to the manner; and ſo incline us to upright walking.</p>

                        <p>But this is ſure, that however in this life, our actions and wayes may be wrapt up with many devices and hidden con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits of Hypocriſie.

                        <p>Of which did we believingly conſider, probable it is that we would attend to uprightneſs of heart and life, to preſent a fair copy of our ſelves to the eye of God.</p>

                     <q>Wherefore I ſay unto you, all manner of ſin and blaſphemy ſhall be forgiven unto men; but the blaſphemy againſt the Holy Ghoſt ſhall not be forgiven unto men.</q>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE beſt of actions are oft-times ſubject to miſconſtructions; and a buſie malice will either find or faſten ſpots upon the pureſt innocency. This Chapter is the Map wherein you may read theſe truths. Chriſt cannot ſpeak or do, but an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious <hi>Phariſee</hi> will pry, and cenſure, and ſlander. Nothing is more offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive to an ill eye, then the light; and that which much afflicts an ill heart, is the beauty of that good which it ſees in, or done by others.</p>
                  <p>Let <hi>Chriſts Diſciples pluck but ſome ears of corn,</hi> only to
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:115641:139"/>
make neceſſary ſatisfaction to natural hunger, <hi>verſe</hi> 1. the Phariſee will preſently pluck at Chriſt himſelf, and murmur him not to be a pattern of obedience, but a pattern of licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſneſs, <hi>Behold thy Diſciples do that which is not lawfull on the Sabbath day.</hi> verſe 2.</p>
                  <p>If Chriſt doth ſtep from the field into the <hi>Synagogue,</hi> verſe 9. there alſo ſhall he have the catching attendance of the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee. Malicious hatred is like the ſhadow which will purſue the body of pious actions. Here he no ſooner finds a fit object for his mercy, but the Phariſees endeavoured to divert the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution by an enſnaring ſcruple, <hi>Is it lawful to heal on the ſabbath daies,</hi> verſe 10. as though the duties of piety juſled out all offices of charity, and that God, who commanded <hi>ſacrifice,</hi> had not alſo <hi>preferred</hi> mercy. They themſelves would reach forth the courteſie of relief to a diſtreſſed beaſt, <hi>v.</hi> 11. and therefore Chriſt might juſtly lend his hand of mercifull Charity to a diſeaſed perſon, <hi>verſe</hi> 12.</p>
                  <p>In the 22. ver. <hi>He heals one poſſeſſed of a devil:</hi> a miracle that begat amazement amongſt the people, and ſome kind of credence concerning his Divinity; but in the <hi>Phariſees</hi> it vent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed plain Blaſphemy. <hi>This fellow caſts out devils by the prince of devils,</hi> verſe 24. A bitter and high reproach, and ſuch as was for the truth, neither <hi>probable</hi> nor <hi>poſſible;</hi> For, Firſt, <hi>Will Satan caſt out Satan?</hi> He that ſeeks the conſtant ſupport, will he willingly overthrow his own Kingdom? Secondly, <hi>Can Satan caſt out Satan?</hi> he that is caſt out, muſt be of leſſer power; and he that doth caſt out, muſt be of greater power: but can Satan be greater and leſſer then himſelf? Theſe Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments could not but convince their judgements, yet they did not extinguſh their malice; they could not deny theſe to be truths, yet will they pertinaciouſly deny their affections to them; what they could not anſwer, they would reſiſt; and though they ſaw ſufficient reaſon and evidence, yet they are reſolved not to believe, but to contemn Chriſt; <hi>Wherefore I ſay unto you, all manner of ſin and blaſphemy ſhall be forgiven unto men, but the blaſphemy againſt the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> &amp;c.

                  <p>Firſt, Whether you reſpect the <hi>ſeveral ſpecies of ſin</hi> may be remitted, <hi>Noah</hi>'s drunkenneſs, <hi>Abraham</hi>'s lying, <hi>David</hi>'s Adultery, <hi>Manaſſe</hi>'s Idolatry, <hi>Peters</hi> denial of Chriſt were remiſſible.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Whether you reſpect the <hi>many degrees and inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of ſin,</hi> either in the multiplied iterations of ſinful acts, or in the acceſſory aggravations of them from the force of cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances in time, place, perſon, object, end, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And that we may not doubt hereof, a ſpecial inſtance is given <note place="margin">Blaſphemy what it is.</note> in a ſin of deepeſt dye and deſert, viz. <hi>Blaſphemy,</hi> this alſo may be remitted. The ſchools tells us, it is ſuch a ſin as either detracts from God that which belongs unto him of right, or faſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens on God reproachfully and diſgracefully that which is not convenient to ſo pure and ſublime Eſſence and Majeſty.</p>
                  <p>And the Scripture tells us, that it wounds or <hi>ſtrikes through the name of God,</hi> Lev. 24. 16. nothing ſo dear to us as our name and reputation, and therefore we are ſenſible of the leaſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignities which touch there; God doth himſelf profeſs how tender and jealous he is of his name and glory; it goes very near to the quick; yet ſuch is the Miracle of his gracious diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, that he hath mercy even for Blaſphemy. I <hi>was a Blaſphemer,</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 13.) <hi>but I obtained mercy.</hi> Only know, that Blaſphemy here pardonable, is not that which ſprings from malice and hatred after conviction, but that of ignorance, as <hi>Pauls</hi>'s, or of infirmitie, as <hi>Peter</hi>'s.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="266" facs="tcp:115641:140"/>
Secondly, <hi>The quality of the act [ſhall be forgiven;]</hi> No <note place="margin">The quality of the Act.</note> ſuch word as that for a ſinner, his life and joy lies in it. Some by theſe words underſtand,</p>
                  <p>1. <hi>Certainty of pardon:</hi> Thus <hi>Theophylact,</hi> who holds the event ſo ſure, that there needs no repentance to obtain par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don for ſins not committed againſt rhe Holy Ghoſt. This er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous opinion need the kindneſs of a large pardon.</p>
                  <p>2. <hi>Deſert of pardon:</hi> Thus <hi>Origen,</hi> l. 1. <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, c. 3. <hi>Qui peccat in filium hominis venia dignus eſt, quia videtur in igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantiam decidiſſe;</hi> there is ſome ground of Apology in this: this opinion is not very unſound, but not genuine.</p>
                  <p>3. <hi>Facility of pardon,</hi> thus <hi>Janſenius</hi> in Concord. <hi>Evang-Remittetur, non quaſi cunctis hominibus remittetur, ſed quod fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile remittetur;</hi> there is not ſo much difficulty to get theſe, as the other to be pardoned.</p>
                  <p>4. Not <hi>Eventum infallibilem ſed poſſibilem,</hi> ſhall be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given, <hi>i. e.</hi> they are ſuch as are not excluded from hope and offer of pardon, not that they are certainly remitted to all in the event, or that they deſerve pardon, or that they are eaſily pardoned; they do not contract a peremptory incapacity of Mercy, but that they may, and if repentance follow, ſhall cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly be forgiven.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>The indeſiniteneſs of the ſubject</hi> (unto men) not <note place="margin">The indefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niteneſs of the ſubject.</note> a man guilty of any manner of ſin, except that againſt the Holy Ghoſt; but ſuch is the rich grace of the great Court of Mercy, that he may take out his pardon. Chriſt doth not ſay, not one ſin, but <hi>All ſin,;</hi> not all ſin of one kind, but all <hi>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of ſin;</hi> all ſin of any kind ſhall be forgiven, not to one man, but to any one; unto <hi>men,</hi> unto any one of the ſons of men: whence we may conclude this comfortable truth.</p>
                  <div type="part">
                     <head>DOCTRINE. <note place="margin">There is a poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don to any ſinner for any ſin, except the ſin againſt the holy Ghoſt.</note>

                     <p>
                        <hi>THat there is a poſſibility of pardon for any Sinner whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and for any ſin whatſoever,</hi> to all men for all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of ſin, <hi>except the ſin against the holy Ghoſt.</hi> Hence the infiniteneſs of Divine Mercy is in <hi>Mica</hi> 7. 19. compared to the <hi>depths of the ſea:</hi> The Ocean is of that vaſt capacity, that

And <hi>Iſa.</hi> 44. 22. it is compared to the <hi>ſtrength of the ſun,</hi> which can ſcatter the darkeſt clouds, as well as conſume the thinneſt vapours. There is in man a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual fountain of ſin, in God a continual fountain of Mercy, <hi>Zac.</hi> 13. 1. ſtill running; yea, there is in man multitude of ſins which ſtream from that corrupt fountain; and there is in God <hi>Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes of Mercies</hi> to heal and ſtop thoſe various currents; <hi>Pſalm</hi> 51. 1. <hi>According to the multitude of thy tender mercies blot out mine offences.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the proſecution of this Truth, I ſhall ſpeak to three things; 1. The Explication of the terms. 2. The demonſtration of the Truth. 3.

                     <p>1. <hi>The Explication of the terms.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>1. <hi>Forgiveneſs of ſin is a gracious act of God in and through-Chriſt, diſcharging the believing and repenting ſinner from the guilt and puniſhment of ſin.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>It is an Act of God.]</hi> The <hi>Donatists</hi> hold that man could forgive the ſins of men: and St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> chalengeth them for ſo bold an Aſſertion, that in this they are worſe then the <hi>Phariſees</hi> who maintained this truth; <hi>Who can forgive ſins, but God?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Object.</hi> It is true, Chriſt committed to his Apoſtles a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterial Abſolution; in his Name, and <hi>virtute officii,</hi> to bind and loſe ſinnes.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sol.</hi> But if we ſpeak of an Authoritative Right and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Power, thus only God forgives. Life and death are on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the abſolute power of the Supream Lord, and becauſe our ſins are directly committed againſt his Juſtice, therefore it belongs only to his Mercy to forgive.</p>
                     <p>2. <hi>It is a gracious Act.]</hi> No way deſerved by the ſinner: <note place="margin">A gracious Act.</note> 
                        <hi>Gratia indebita liberata,</hi> ſaid St. <hi>Auſtin.</hi> Hence in Scripture you find our forgiveneſs like a ſtream iſſuing out of rich Mercy, Great love, and the riches of Grace: and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet ſpeaking of forgiveneſs, uſually adjoynes, <hi>For thy Mercy ſake, for thine own ſake,</hi> intimating that forgiveneſs is a free Act, not purchaſed, but given, not merited, but granted. There is I acknowledge, <hi>A double graciouſneſs</hi> in the diſcharge of an offendor.</p>
                     <p>

One <hi>without any ſatisfaction at all.</hi> I am much miſtaken if <hi>Socinus</hi> and his Atheiſtical Complices run not this way.</p>
                     <p>Another is, <hi rend="margQuotes">When the ſatisfaction of a ſurety is accepted for the principal debt.</hi> In this reſpect is our forgiveneſs gracious; not that Juſtice is not at all ſatisfied, but that the offendor himſelf never ſatisfied it; he is diſcharged by the price which a bleſſed Mediator laid down.</p>
                     <p>3. <hi>Diſcharging the ſinner of guilt and puniſhment.]</hi> There <note place="margin">Diſcharging the ſinner of guilt and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment.</note> are two things in ſin.</p>
                     <p>One is the <hi rend="margQuotes">ſtain,</hi> pollution, or defiling quality of it, and this is the Object of <hi>Sanctification,</hi> which is to it as a medicine to a diſeaſe, or as water to ſpots, or as health to ſickneſs, gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually altering, healing, cleanſing.</p>
                     <p>Another is the <hi rend="margQuotes">Guilt,</hi> which binds over the ſinner to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, wrath and damnation; this is the object of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs; in it ſin is not healed, but pardoned: the diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the ſinner is not altered, but his condition. When the King pardons a thief, his theft now ſhall not prejudice him, ſo in Gods mercifull forgiveneſs, ſinfull guilt is ſo effectually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, that finally and redundantly it ſhall never prejudice the eternal life and ſalvation of the perſon: much more might be ſaid of this ſubject, but I am unwilling to inſiſt on any more then ſerves to inlighten the point in hand.</p>

How can it be ſaid, <hi>Whoſoever believes ſhall be ſaved,</hi> unleſs you grant a poſſibility of mercy.</p>
                     <p>5. <hi>The effects of mercy in the Creature,</hi> which point to an infinite fulneſs in the Creator. The vertue in the cauſe ever <note place="margin">The effects of Mercy in the Creature.</note> exceeds that in the effect; and according to the generality in the cauſe, is the intention of the vertue in that cauſe. If I diſcern any light in the beams, I apprehend much more in the Sun: If I feel any moiſture in ſmaller drops, I know there is much more in the large ocean. All the mercy in the Creature is derivative, and as ſo many beams and drops lead us to the infinite fulneſs of mercy in God, the univerſal and prime fountain of all compaſſion. God himſelf reaſons from the compaſſion of a mother to her own; and Chriſt tells us, <hi>If we forgive thoſe that treſpaſs againſt us, our heavenly Father will alſo forgive us our treſpaſſes.</hi> Surely if we muſt forgive ſeventy times, God doth much more multiply forgiveneſſes.</p>

This is the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon unto whom I freely offered the pardon of all the ſins that ever he committed; and offered him in the word of God, that if he would leave his ſins, I would forgive them, but he preferred his ſins before my mercy; <hi>For lying vanities he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſook his mercies.</hi> And thy own conſcience ſhall then teſtifie that thus it was, I had mercy offered again and again, and yet I would continue in my ſins.

But the main uſe I would make of this point, is <hi>To perſwade men to make out for this pardon:</hi> you ſee here the extent of Mercy, the poſſibility of pardon. <hi>Why do you look one upon another?</hi> (ſaid <hi>Jacob</hi> to his ſons) <hi>Behold, I have heard there is corn in Egypt, get you down thither, that we may live, and not die:</hi> Why ſtand you amazed and backward, you that are ſo full of ſpiritual wants; why come you not to mercy that you may live and not die? here is a ſtore-houſe of mercy, <hi>Behold,</hi> ſaid the ſervants of <hi>Benhadab, We have heard that the King of Iſrael is a mercifull King, let us go to him, peradventure he will ſave thy life,</hi> 1 <hi>King</hi> 20. 31.

tender of the freeſt pardon. <hi>As I live,</hi> ſaith the Lord, <hi>I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light not in the death of a ſinner;</hi> Why will you die, <hi>O houſe of Iſrael?</hi> Why do we by lying vanities forſake our Mercies? how my ſoul bleeds at the wretched hardneſs of our hearts. God is mercifull, and we are ſinfull; yea, we are the more bold in ſin, becauſe God is the more abundant in mercy, <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in ſin, becauſe Grace doth abound,</hi> Rom. 6. 1. Thus do we abuſe the grace God to wantonneſs, and bane our ſouls by the ſweet Remedy of ſin. <hi>There is mercy with thee, that thou mayeſt be feared,</hi> ſaid <hi>David: and he who confeſſeth and forſak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his ſins, ſhall have mercy,</hi> ſaith <hi>Solomon: and knoweſt thou not that the mercies of God ſhould lead thee to Repentance,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul:</hi> conſider,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>The preſence of Mercy ſaves not, but the acceptance:</hi> the offer of a pardon delivers not the Malefactor, but the receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it: only the embracing makes us happy: mercy proves not mercy, but by acceptance; the contempt of it ſtrangly al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters it into Juſtice.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>The deſpiſing of mercy leaves without all excuſe;</hi> what haſt thou to urge againſt God, who could not urge and faſten his mercy on thy ſoul? yes, thou wouldſt have a licence but not a <hi>pardon.</hi> I know thou warmeſt thy ſoul with the ſound of mercy, not to abate, but to encourage thy ſinfull appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite: Why doſt thou not break thy arm, becauſe there is a skilfull Chirurgion, or fall into the ſtrongeſt diſeaſes, becauſe there is a skilfull Phyſitian?</p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>Continuance in ſin, and efficacy of Mercy are inconſiſtent: thou through thy impenitent heart, in ſtead of mercy, treaſureſt up unto thy ſelf wrath againſt the day of wrath,</hi> Rom. 2. 5.</p>

By, Firſt, <hi>Treading under foot the Son of God,</hi> the moſt baſe eſteem of Chriſt, reſpecting him no more then the impureſt dirt in the ſtreets, or the moſt vile thing, as <hi>Ambroſe</hi> expounds it.

Secondly, <hi>Counting the blood of the Covenant an unholy thing:</hi> The blood of Chriſt is the blood of the new Covenant; it is it wherein Promiſes of life are made, it is it whereby reconciliation with God is effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually made, it is it by which we obtain ſalvation, and this blood it is called <hi>Precious</hi> in Scripture: but he that ſins againſt the Holy Ghoſt, vilipends this blood, he doth no more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt of it, then the blood of a moſt common thief and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hallowed perſon.</p>

                     <p>Firſt, How the Holy Ghoſt is taken.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, What the Conviction by the Holy Ghoſt is.</p>
                     <p>1. The Holy Ghoſt is ſometime taken; Firſt, <hi>Eſſentially,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">How the Holy Ghoſt is taken.</note> for that one infinite, indiviſible, independent Deity. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, <hi>Perſonally,</hi> as the third perſon in Trinity proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the Father and the Son. Thirdly, <hi>Virtually,</hi> In reſpect of Energy or operation, and this <hi>Origen</hi> calls, <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietatem</hi>

                        <hi>gratiae, &amp; Aquinas bonum ſpirito appropriatum:</hi> for though external operations be common to the Trinity, yet the immediate manner of working is more common to one perſon then another, as the work of <hi>Creation</hi> to the <hi>Father, Redemption</hi> to the Son, <hi>Illumination</hi> and <hi>Sanctification</hi> to the <hi>Holy Ghoſt.</hi> Thus is the holy Ghoſt here conſidered in his proper operation, <hi>viz. Conviction.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, The operation or conviction of this perſon by the Holy Ghoſt, conſiſts in theſe particulars. <note place="margin">What this conviction is. Objective. Patifactio.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>Firſt, The clear <hi>Revelation of Jeſus Christ in the Goſpel,</hi> both in reſpect of <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Goodneſs;</hi> of <hi>Truth,</hi> that he is the true and only Son of God; of <hi>Goodneſs,</hi> that he is the
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:115641:150"/>
Redeemer of the world, and aſſured Saviour to Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>There is by the Holy Ghoſt wrought in them an Apprehenſion of all this by a ſupernatural illumination,</hi> as in <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 4. <hi>They were once inlightned,</hi> not <hi>naturali lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,</hi> for by that of conſcience every one is inlightned, but <hi>lumine ſupernaturali,</hi> by that of the Spirit.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, <hi>Not a ſleighter apprehenſion, but a more deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate Conviction;</hi> ſo that they cannot deny the truth; the light whereof ſhines with ſuch clear beams upon the underſtanding. The teſtimony of the conſcience deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minately aſſents with the teſtimony of the Spirit, that this Revealed Goſpel, is indeed the Goſpel of Chriſt and of ſalvation. <hi>You know who I am, and whence I come,</hi> ſaith <hi>Chriſt to the Phariſees; yea,</hi> themſelves profeſſed ſo much, <hi>becauſe ye ſay we ſee, therefore your ſins remain,</hi> John 9.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, Nay, yet <hi>undeniable Conviction is not all,</hi> there is alſo ſome kind of <hi>approbation of thoſe truths,</hi> which the Apoſtle calls <hi>A taſting of the heavenly gift, and a taſting of the good word of God, and of the powers of the world to come.</hi> A man may have a little taſte of Honey, ſo that he can ſay, I know it is ſweet; and of wine, that he can ſay, it is comfortable: In like manner, they who ſin this ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt may feel his opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, not only in an objective revelation, not only in a ſubjective apprehenſion, not only in an undeniable conviction, but alſo in ſome degree of approbation. There may drop ſome effects from the truth imprinted upon the affections that the Conſcience may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, and give teſtimonie aſſuredly that theſe are the very truths of Chriſt. All which is very evident in ſome of the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> who had Chriſt revealed to them, who did know, and were convinced in their own hearts who Chriſt was, and what his Doctrine was, yet did they with inward malice break out againſt him, and his Doctrine, and in words poured the baſeſt contumelies and blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:115641:151"/>
upon him; and in their pertinacious workings did conſtantly perſecute him, even to the moſt reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full death of the Croſs, and all this againſt the cleareſt Convictions of the Holy Ghoſt in their own Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences.</p>

every one is equal in Nature and Dignity.</p>
                     <p>2. Nor is it becauſe this ſin is ſo intenſively great, that exceeds the abſolute power of God to forgive it, or the infinite Merits of Chriſt. <hi>Omnipotenti Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dico nullus inſanabilis occurrit languor;</hi> Iſidore.</p>
                     <p>But the Reaſons given are theſe.</p>

This Reaſon is true, but becauſe it is of common equity to ſome other ſins, therefore further ſatisfaction may be ſought.</p>
